<p>After our big trip in Washigton, we decided our next adventure was going to be <a href="http://www.colonialwilliamsburg.com/">Colonial Williamsburg</a> for some more history, so we found a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Harbor+View+RV+Resort+%26+Campground/@38.2061503,-76.9790852,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5904ce01d43eeb92">litte campground outside of Colonial Beach, VA</a> that was <strong>waaaay</strong> off the beaten path (the &quot;beaten path&quot; was actually 5 miles north of us).</p>
<p>The first couple of days we spent just hanging around the park and in and out of Colonial Beach. We found a cool little restaurant/bar right on what they call a &quot;beach&quot; and watched the World Cup games for a couple of afternoons. The restaurant sits on the Potamic River and the girls played in the sand so they had a good time.</p>

<p>One of the highlight of these first couple of days was grocery shopping at this small little store near us. They had mini-shopping carts and the girls had a blast shopping with mommy.</p>

<p>Friday afternoon we went blackberry picking at a local farm. We fed the goats, picked berries and had raspberry sundaes afterwards. We picked a ton of blackberries (Cathy made cobbler and sangria later!) but we didn't find too many raspberries. Fun afternoon and a new experience for the girls.</p>

<p>The weekend finally arrived and we were off to Colonial Williamsburg for the day. If you ever are near Colonial Williamsburg you should definitely make it a point to stop by. What a great experience! Everyone is dressed and acts as if it's the colonial period. Hali and I got to be spies for the Colonial Army while the girls went on a scavenger hunt with mom. There were floppy hats to buy, blacksmiths to visit, muskets to load, jails to tour and parades to watch. Colonial Williamsburg was definitely the highlight of our trip to Virginia.</p>
<p>On Sunday we decided to something fun and different with the girls. It was time to take a break from &quot;going&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; and just be kids. We discovered that <a href="https://www.kingsdominion.com/">Kings Dominion</a> amusement park was about an hour away and it included an awesome waterpark with admission! FTW! So we spent the <strong>entire day</strong> riding rollercoasters, crashing bumpercars and floating down the &quot;lazy river&quot;. We literally rode rides till they kicked us out after the fireworks.</p>
