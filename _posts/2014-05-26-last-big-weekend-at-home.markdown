<p>So this weekend was our last chance to get rid of our stuff. We've had 5 garage sales so far and everything needed to go one way or another. We didn't sell everything so the rest was carted off to Goodwill. So we loaded up the borrowed trailer and took two load of our &quot;unwanted stuff&quot; to Goodwill. The girls did a great job helping to load and unload the trailer so we rewarded them with a trip the to beach. Probably their last at Siesta Key!</p>
