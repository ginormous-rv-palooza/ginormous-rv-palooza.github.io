<p>The &quot;man in the big truck&quot; dropped the PODS in our driveway this morning and, as you can see, everyone is super excited. One week untill we leave so it's crunch time. I spent most of the day hauling stuff over to relative's houses and selling and/or giving away furniture from Brittany's condo off craigslist. What a PITA.</p>
<p>We've cleaned out most of our house so we're down to the final packing. Cathy and I started to move some bedroom furniture into the PODS and we'll soon be breaking down beads and generally making the house look deserted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have to go to San Francisco for a couple of days this week so she'll be on her own. When I get back we'll finish getting everything into the PODS and then end the week by living in the driveway. We hit the road Father's Day!!</p>
