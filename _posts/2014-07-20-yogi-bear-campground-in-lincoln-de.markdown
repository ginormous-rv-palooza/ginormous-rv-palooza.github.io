<p>Delaware was our first stop at a themed campground. Cathy found the &quot;Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park Camp-Resort&quot; and it looked fun so we thought we'd try it out. A little expensive but the girls had a great time.</p>
<p>The girls, of course, had never heard of &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; (he's not on SpongeBob) but they quickly became fans. Kira became quite obsessed with Yogi and Boo-Boo during our visit. She insisted on calling me &quot;Yogi&quot; for most of our stay while she was of course &quot;Boo-Boo&quot;.</p>

<p>The drive to Delaware was a little rocky. We stopped for lunch in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=Bowie,+Maryland">Bowie, MD</a> and when I came back to the RV I noticed a flat tire. We soon discovered that RVs don't come with jacks and your only option is road side assistance or something similar. Luckily we seemed to be in the tire capital of the world so we didn't panic. There was a couple of tire centers less than a mile away. After calling aroud, we finally found an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/NTB/175921049113314">NTB tire center</a> that said they could change an RV tire so we limped around the block to it. They were super helpful but in the end informed us they couldn't lift our vehicle with their jack. They gave us a couple of recommendations and even jumped on the phones to find road side assistance for us.</p>
<p>I called the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OurismanBowie">Chevy dealer</a> across the street and luckily the service manager was an RV'er and said he could change our tire. So, again, we limped across the street and they changed the tire during the start of a rain storm.</p>
<p>The entire flat tire ordeal took about 5 hours to resolve. It was super stressful but we survived and didn't lose our tempers with one another (+1 for marrying an awesome woman!). Naturally we arrived at the park late that night but in one piece.</p>
<p>We spent most of the time at the park doing activities. The girls got to wake up and put Yogi to bed each day. The wakeup routine included morning exercises with Yogi followed by a hayride. At night they read Yogi a story and tucked him into bed. There was also afternoon movies (without parents!!) in the kids center. They had a nice pool and playground so the kids spent quite a bit of time there as well.</p>

<p>We did venture out for one excursion during our stay. Cathy discovered that they have wild ponies on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chincoteague+Island,+VA/@37.9457804,-75.3363337,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89b9427cfa368c3f:0xb19a5c73e20a4219">Chincoteague Island</a> about an hour south. They have boat tours that take you over to the island so you can watch the ponies. She <strong>really</strong> wanted to see the ponies so we drive down after work. The trip turned out to be a bust. First, the drive was actually 2 hours each way instead of one. Second, the boat trip was expensive and we never saw any ponies. Apparently they were hiding or taking a smoke break or something. However, on our hour and a half boat tour we did see a bald eagle from about a half mile away. That was good?</p>
<p>Highlight of the stay for me was that my ankle felt good enough for a short run! Hurrah!!</p>
