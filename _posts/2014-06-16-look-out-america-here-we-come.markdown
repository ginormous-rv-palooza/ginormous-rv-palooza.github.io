<p>Yesterday was the magic day and we are now officially on our &quot;Ginormous RV Palooza&quot;! Look out America!</p>
<p>The day was actually quite a blur. Our goal was to get the house completly cleaned out and the RV packed up and ready to go by 10am. We were heading to Cathy's sister's house for Father's Day by 11am.</p>
<p>So we got us about 7am and got started. Most of the house was alreay cleaned out so all that was left was some stuff in the kitched and the garage. However, there were a number of loose ends that needed to be tied up. I had to make a run to Goodwill, drop off the garbage at our friend Sharon's house (trash doesn't come until Tuesday) and meet someone laying carpet at our rental condo. On top of that, the person that purchased our dining room table didn't show up until 9:45 am. We talked to our new tenants (our super cool friends/neighbors/tenants) and gave them the keys and a quick walk through.</p>

<p><strong>Then</strong> we were finally officially out of our house. I thought it would feel strange but everything was moving so fast and there was such an adreneline rush that it didn't even phase us.</p>
<p>So then we spent a few hours with the family, exchanged tearful hugs and then hit the road for St. Augustine.</p>

<p>We got to St. Augustine around 5pm, get everything setup and then went to one of our favorite spots, The Conch House, for dinner. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a &quot;tiki hut&quot; table over the water!</p>
<p>The first day is in the record books and no major disaster. That's one for the win column.</p>
