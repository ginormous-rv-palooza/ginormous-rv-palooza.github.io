<p>Yesterday was what I felt like was officially the first day of getting ready for our trip. We spent most of last night cleaning out closets, drawers and nooks and crannies of our crap. It was a liberating feeling to get rid of so much of the $#(! that we've accumalited over the past 13 years. I found clothes I haven't worn in years, papers and documents from when the 3 older kids were litle and even a blank VHS tape!</p>
<p>We had a successful garage sale this morning, with many more to come, where we transferred the ownership of our crap to other families. Yah! We've got so much more to do but I'm actually looking forward to &quot;the purge&quot;.</p>
