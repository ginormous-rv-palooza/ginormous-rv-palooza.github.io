<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSw1F-E_M2A">I love maps</a> and I wanted an easy way to display our route across America. I thought it would be cool for the girls (and everyone else) to look back at the places we've been. So I wrote a small little application for my phone using <a href="https://appery.io">appery.io</a> that saves my current location and displays it on a map.</p>

<p>So when we get to a cool place, let's say Savannah, I can enter my coordinates and short description about where we are at and save it to the database. People can then view the <a href="/map">Map page</a> and follow our journey. Quick, simple and cool.</p>
