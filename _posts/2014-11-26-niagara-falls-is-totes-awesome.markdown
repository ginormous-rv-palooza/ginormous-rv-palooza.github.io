<p>Niagara Falls was one of our favorite stops; top 3s for sure! The campground wasn't that great (essentially a parking lot) but the falls more than made up for it. <strong>They were simply incredible!!!</strong></p>
<p>It was a <em>long</em> trip from Vermont to Niagara and we (as in Cathy driving) pulled into the campground around 5pm on Monday. We unloaded, setup camp and headed out to the a local restaurant that was recommended by the hotel staff. The city of Niagara was a little depressing, being in the middle of the rust belt, but we did find a couple of jewels.</p>

<p>Tuesday was our big day in Niagara and I took the day off. We did a guided tour and saw everything! <strong>Niagara Falls was simply incredible.</strong> We did the Whirlpool State Park, took a boat ride under the American Falls, saw the Cave of the Winds and played on the Hurricane Deck.</p>

<p>Words don't do Niagara justice. I simply can't describe how awesome it was and how much fun the girls had despite the light rain. Check out the pictures and videos below for the full experience. After a long day touring the falls we stopped at the <a href="http://www.thegriffonpub.com/">Griffon Pub</a> for craft beer and #awesome food. Dinner was definitely a runner-up to the Falls.</p>

<p>Wednesday was a school and work day. The highlight was going back to the Griffin Pub (did I mention they have tons of craft beer and great food?!) and then shopping for Halloween costumes. We found a store that was part costume shopping and part haunted house. The store scared the crap out of all three of the girls and we spent <em>waayyy</em> too much money on costumes.</p>

<p>Thursday morning we packed up and headed to Pittsburgh so I could fly out to SF for Dreamforce.</p>
