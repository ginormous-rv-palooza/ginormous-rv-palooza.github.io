The girls order some gigantic desserts from Kaminsky's next door while Cathy and I had a beer. \\n\\nI worked all day Friday while the girls rode bikes around the park and went to the pool.

We decided to take the tour guide up on her recommendation for [Lowcountry Bistro](http://www.lowcountrybistro.com/). OMG was it awesome!! Chicken and waffles FTW!!

There wasn't a cloud in the sky and it was pushing 95 degrees. We broke our \\\"one place\\\" eating rule and went back to Angel Oak Restaurant for beignets (we were told they were the best!). The girls loved them!! Then it was off to see the actual [Angel Oak tree](http://www.angeloaktree.org/). I'd seen reviews of the tree and was dying to go. It's reported to be the oldest living thing east of the Rockies at roughly 1500 years old! It didn't disappoint. Truly amazing. Then we hit one more graveyard on the way out as Kira can't get enough of them. She loves wandering through them for some reason.\\n\\nSunday was another highly anticipated day for a number of reasons. Since it had been so hot we decided the day before to visit [Ft. Sumter](http://www.nps.gov/fosu/index.htm) early in the morning. We took the 9:30 ferry to the island and toured it for an hour. We had a great time and I think the girls really learned a lot about the start of the Civil War and slavery in general. It was a hot topic. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Jun/SAM_0232.jpg)\\n\\nAfter the tour we headed back to TBonz (we didn't *technically* eat there before as we only had beer and dessert) and had lunch and watched some soccer. We spent the rest of the day in the RV waiting for the 6pm USA vs. Portugal game to start.

The entire walk to the metro was a mess and the line was backed up for what seemed like hours. We waited for quite a long time (like everyone else) and finally punted and walked 10 blocks or so to another metro station. The girls were super tired but didn't complain once. Kira was a trooper leading the way.

Cathy made pancakes and mimosas and we listened to Prince during breakfast. That made her happy. We planned a light day, only visiting the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.

If you ever need a travel agent, let me know and I'll give you her number.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/philly1.jpg)\\n\\nWe left Yogi Bear campground Friday morning but didn't have a place to stay that evening (we practice \\\"just in time\\\" camping). We made calls during the morning and found a campground out in the middle of corn-country with a small lake!! That was new to Cathy so she naturally booked it. It was a nice little campground but it seemed like it was inhabited by mostly locals. Older trailers, \\\"permanent\\\" guests and plenty of late night partying. Any ways, the staff was really nice, the lake was a huge hit but the internet was, unfortunately, terrible. We spent the first day setting up, swimming in the lake (the girls made new friends as usual), eating dinner and planning the weekend in Philadelphia.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/philly2.jpg)\\n\\nWe got up Saturday morning and prepared for the day. The plans were to head into Philadelphia and then back in town for the local [Cowtown Rodeo](http://www.cowtownrodeo.com/) (the longest running weekly rodeo in the United States, it was started in 1929). So we packed up late morning and headed to Philly to see the [USS New Jersey Battleship](http://www.battleshipnewjersey.org/). Everyone had a blast touring the Battleship!! We toured the innards of the ship, the kids got to load rounds into the 16\\\" main guns and even \\\"fire\\\" them from the command center. Super cool! Kira was a little freaked out by the narrow, steep stairs but besides that she was fine. After the 1 1/2 hour tour, all three girls road the flight simulator by the gift shop. No one got sick but they weren't too thrilled with it. \\n\\nAfter the battleship we went across the river into Philly's \\\"Old Town\\\" and had half-price appetizers before heading home. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ended up spending way too much money. Not sure why, but afterwards we even stopped at a nearby Dairy Queen.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/philly3.jpg)\\n\\nWe had purchased ticket to the local rodeo the day before so everyone had to get their cowgirl gear on before we left. The rodeo was better than expected but super long. It didn't start until 7:30pm and by 9pm or 9:30pm, the girls were dead so we headed home. We had set the tent up the previous day and the girls slept in it by themselves for the first time.\\n\\nSunday was our big day for touring Philadelphia so we headed into the city and did a \\\"hop on hop off\\\" bus tour. We saw some pretty cool stuff but the day was rather disappointing. I guess it's hard to follow Washington. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/mega-slice1.jpg)\\n\\nThe girls had fun with the audio tour at Betsy Ross's house and Kira loved Ben Franklin's grave down the road. It was mid-day after Ben's grave so we stopped by a local pizza place for lunch. The girls had \\\"mega slices\\\" and I had my first Philly Cheesesteak. They didn't serve beer at the restaurant (what!! pizza with no beer!?) but our waitress encouraged me to run across the street and fetch a couple of bottles. Good call!\\n\\n<img src=\\\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/prison.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width:250px;padding-right:10px\\\" alt=\\\"Awesome mobile app\\\" align=\\\"left\\\">\\n\\nAfter lunch we hopped back on the bus and headed over to the Constitution Museum. However, the Constitution isn't actually housed there; it's in DC (#fail). The remainder of the tour was spent mostly at the old prison, [Eastern State Penitentiary](http://www.easternstate.org/). Super spooky and strange but everyone seemed to like the audio tour. We got some really nice pictures of the girls behind bars. We contemplated leaving them there for awhile. ;) We rode the bus around town for awhile and then headed back home. The girls watched movies for the rest of the evening in their tent while Cathy and I brought our reclining lawn chairs into the RV and watched TV (yes... red-neck).\\n\\nMonday was our last day in NJ and we decided to head into Atlantic City after I finished work.

So she gave us a discount on the rate and a prime spot at the top of the hill. Loved it!! We spent the rest of the day unpacking, working and swimming in the little kiddie pool. Later that night we ventured out into the local community and found a Barnes & Noble so the girls could spend their gift cards from Grandma. \\n\\nWhile I worked the next day, Cathy took the girls to [Alstede Farms](http://alstedefarms.com/) to pick berries and eat ice cream. After work we decided to head into NYC and show the girls Time Square. According to the GPS, it was only a one hour drive but, apparently, that was only to the Holland Tunnel. It took an hour to drive the 5-10 miles from the Tunnel into the city. Traffic was a mess but I guess that's typical. We found a parking spot shortly after arriving and walked the couple of blocks to Times Square. First on the agenda.... pizza! We found a nice place off of Broadway for a slice and then headed up and down Times Square. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/2014-07-23-19-48-17.jpg)\\n\\nThe girls weren't thrilled by the crowds but did like lights and billboards.

Take a look at their site as they have some really cool pictures with gun fights, stage coach rides, petting zoos and such. I joined shortly after I got off work for an hour or so. We headed home, the girls had cotton candy for dessert (we are bad parents) and Cathy and I snuggled up under the blanket outside and watched TV. The weather was quite chilly for most of the night in NJ.\\n\\nFriday was a rest day as we had big plans for the weekend in NYC. We found out there was a Macaroni Grill on the other side of the RV park (literally 50 yards after climbing out little hill we were at the base of) so we went there for lunch. I worked all day of course while Cathy did laundry and made a lazy day out of it.\\n\\nSaturday was the big day in NYC. I wanted to take the girls to a Broadway show but couldn't stomach $200 per person for tickets to Wicked or Lion King. Luckily we found reasonable tickets to Cinderella and the girls loved it! \\n\\n<iframe src=\\\"//player.vimeo.com/video/103295665\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"281\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>\\n\\nWe got up early and headed into NYC. We parked in Jersey City and took the PATH train to Manhattan. We hopped on the subway and took it north to Central Park. It started to rain, and it was lunch time, so we found a little Irish pub called Coliseum to wait out the shower. Shortly afterwards we made our way to Central Park, walked around for quite awhile and then decided to take a carriage ride through the park. The girls had a great time and even got to give the horse a treat afterwards. We walked around a little more, climbed on rocks but decided to skip the zoo since there were no lions, zebras or giraffes. After the park it was a hop, skip and a jump to FAO Schwarz to show the kids the toy and tell them they couldn't have any.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/2014-07-26-16-21-33.jpg\\\">\\n\\nAt that point I had my mind made up that I wanted to go to [Ferrara Bakery & Cafe](http://www.ferraracafe.com/) in Little Italy. One of my favorite places in the city. The desserts and coffee were great but the services sucked. We had a great time overall and everyone left full and happy. Great photos of empty plates and chocolate covered faces.\\n\\nWe then took the subway back towards Time Square for Cinderella. Luckily we had to switch trains at Grand Central Station as the girls really wanted to see it. They wanted to see what the real location looked like from their favorite movie Madagascar. We wandered around a couple of hours, took pictures and visited the Apple store. Then off to Cinderella! The show was great and the girls really enjoyed it. The show ended around 10pm, we had to take the subway back to the PATH train, take the PATH train back to Jersey City, walk to our car and then drive home. We arrived home about **1:30am** and poured everyone into bed. Super long day!!\\n\\n<img src=\\\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/2014-07-27-15-56-49.jpg\\\" style=\\\"padding-right:10px; width:300px\\\" align=\\\"left\\\">\\n\\nWe got up Sunday late as everyone was exhausted. However, it was the weekend and we were still in NYC so there was stuff to see! Our only goal for Sunday was the Statue of Liberty and pizza at Lombardi's. So after lunch we drove to Liberty Square in NJ to catch the boat to the Statue. We skipped Ellis Island (I regret that decision now) and headed straight to the Statue. We took the audio guided tour and everyone had a blast learning about how the status was built and the immigrants that came through Ellis Island. We took a ton of great photos and they finally had to kick us out. Literally. They were closing.\\n\\nAfter the Statue tour we decided to drive over to Little Italy for pizza at Lombardi's but the wait was too long. Typical. So we found a little restaurant on the street and had a nice little dinner. The tables were like Italy, placed so close together that we actually had a meal with the 20-something girls next to us. Apparently they have rough lives being professional, single girls in the city. You should have heard!!\\n\\nI took the day off on Monday as it was our last day in NYC. Hali really wanted to see the Empire State Building and I wanted to stop by the 911 Memorial. We had to be home by 6pm as we were having dinner with one of boys we had fostered. He was 3 now and living with his grand parents nearby.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Aug/2014-07-28-12-23-10.jpg)\\n\\nSo, we took off after breakfast and headed to the PATH station in Jersey City (I was pretty good at finding the station by this time). The PATH dumped us off near the Empire State Building but we decided to get a slice before the tour. The girls get cranky when they don't eat every 2-3 hours. The audio tour of the Empire State Building was a lot of fun and we had a good time taking pictures from the Observation Deck (86th floor but we walked up 6 flights). We spent almost 3 hours in the building listening to how it was made and learning the history of the building. Really great learning experience.\\n\\nThen we headed over to the 911 Memorial but had a difficult time finding it due to the construction. Unfortunately the next available tour was at 3:30pm which was too late for us as we had 6pm dinner plans. We were only able to walk around the two memorials and take pictures and tell the girls about what happened in September. It would have been much more memorable to see and hear it all in tour. I also regret not staying longer in NYC and doing the 911 Memorial. Maybe we'll have to stop by NYC again some day. \\n\\nDates: July 22 - July 29  \\nRV Park: [Fla-Net Park](http://flanetpark.com), Flanders, NJ\\n\\n<object width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157645942641540%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157645942641540%2F&set_id=72157645942641540&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=143270\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=143270\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157645942641540%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157645942641540%2F&set_id=72157645942641540&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\"></embed></object>\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Flanders, NJ is about an hour west of NYC and it was the closest spot we could find to the city.

There was a campground right across from Manhattan but\nunfortunately they were book until Jesus returns. Anyway, the trips to NYC\nweren't that bad and the RV spot turned out to be pretty sweet. We ended up\nstaying a week and making a number of trips to NYC for things like pizza,\nsight-seeing and a show on Broadway.\n\nFirst off... NJ has some crazy roads and rules. The roads are super windy and\nconfusing and about drove me crazy. You can't make a left turn on the main roads\nso there are signs that say, \"For left turn and U turn, keep right\" and you make\nthis whacky loop around the road and wait at the light. Plus, all of the gas\nstations are full service so that threw me as well.\n\n\n\nAnyway, we arrived at the RV park around noon and found out that the girl at the\nfront desk went to USF [http://www.usf.edu/] as did our son Scott. So she gave\nus a discount on the rate and a prime spot at the top of the hill. Loved it!! We\nspent the rest of the day unpacking, working and swimming in the little kiddie\npool. Later that night we ventured out into the local community and found a\nBarnes & Noble so the girls could spend their gift cards from Grandma.\n\nWhile I worked the next day, Cathy took the girls to Alstede Farms\n[http://alstedefarms.com/] to pick berries and eat ice cream. After work we\ndecided to head into NYC and show the girls Time Square. According to the GPS,\nit was only a one hour drive but, apparently, that was only to the Holland\nTunnel. It took an hour to drive the 5-10 miles from the Tunnel into the city.\nTraffic was a mess but I guess that's typical. We found a parking spot shortly\nafter arriving and walked the couple of blocks to Times Square. First on the\nagenda.... pizza! We found a nice place off of Broadway for a slice and then\nheaded up and down Times Square.\n\n\n\nThe girls weren't thrilled by the crowds but did like lights and billboards. We\ntried to text our name on to the Coke billboard but it never showed up.\n#cokefail Around 8:30pm it started to sprinkle as we walked back to the car and\nthen we were caught in a down pour. Everyone was soaked by the time we got back\nto the car. However, the drive home was much quicker!!\n\nThe next day was Thursday and Cathy took the kids that morning to Wild West City\n[http://www.wildwestcity.com/], a western heritage theme park recreating 1880's\nlife, near the RV park. Take a look at their site as they have some really cool\npictures with gun fights, stage coach rides, petting zoos and such. I joined\nshortly after I got off work for an hour or so. We headed home, the girls had\ncotton candy for dessert (we are bad parents) and Cathy and I snuggled up under\nthe blanket outside and watched TV. The weather was quite chilly for most of the\nnight in NJ.\n\nFriday was a rest day as we had big plans for the weekend in NYC. We found out\nthere was a Macaroni Grill on the other side of the RV park (literally 50 yards\nafter climbing out little hill we were at the base of) so we went there for\nlunch. I worked all day of course while Cathy did laundry and made a lazy day\nout of it.\n\nSaturday was the big day in NYC. I wanted to take the girls to a Broadway show\nbut couldn't stomach $200 per person for tickets to Wicked or Lion King. Luckily\nwe found reasonable tickets to Cinderella and the girls loved it!\n\n\nWe got up early and headed into NYC. We parked in Jersey City and took the PATH\ntrain to Manhattan. We hopped on the subway and took it north to Central Park.\nIt started to rain, and it was lunch time, so we found a little Irish pub called\nColiseum to wait out the shower. Shortly afterwards we made our way to Central\nPark, walked around for quite awhile and then decided to take a carriage ride\nthrough the park. The girls had a great time and even got to give the horse a\ntreat afterwards. We walked around a little more, climbed on rocks but decided\nto skip the zoo since there were no lions, zebras or giraffes. After the park it\nwas a hop, skip and a jump to FAO Schwarz to show the kids the toy and tell them\nthey couldn't have any.\n\nAt that point I had my mind made up that I wanted to go to Ferrara Bakery & Cafe\n[http://www.ferraracafe.com/] in Little Italy. One of my favorite places in the\ncity. The desserts and coffee were great but the services sucked. We had a great\ntime overall and everyone left full and happy. Great photos of empty plates and\nchocolate covered faces.\n\nWe then took the subway back towards Time Square for Cinderella. Luckily we had\nto switch trains at Grand Central Station as the girls really wanted to see it.\nThey wanted to see what the real location looked like from their favorite movie\nMadagascar. We wandered around a couple of hours, took pictures and visited the\nApple store. Then off to Cinderella! The show was great and the girls really\nenjoyed it.

The people at the front desk were very nice and we alerted them to the fact that we were having, what seemed like, several thousand boxes of K-12 learning materials sent there. We pulled into our spot, setup camp and I worked for the rest of the day while the girls wandered around the campground.\\n\\nAfter work we immediately took off for Plymouth to look at that rock. It wasn't going to watch itself, ya know! We made a big deal of the rock, took some cool action photos of the rock, talked about what it meant and discussed why the Pilgrims came to this country. We then promptly left and went to eat. ;)\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Sep/15054496789_3fa76770b7_k.jpg)\\n\\nFor the next couple of day was stayed around the campground, swimming in the local pond (the water gave Kira a rash each time she went in) and riding bicycles. There was a large group of homeschoolers at the campground so the girls had plenty of kids to play with. \\n\\nCathy and I even ran a number of times so we didn't feel as fat as usual.

Kira wasn't as freaked out this time and everyone learned a lot about the living conditions, why they came to America, how long the journey took and how many perished on the trip. Our neighbor is related to one of the Pilgrims (John Alden) so that really allowed us to tie to past to the present. \\n\\nAfterwards, we walked down the street to the pier and booked a whale watching trip for Sunday! Then we went and had massive sized desserts at a local restaurant with live music.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/Sep/15054026149_dadcf2caf1_k.jpg)\\n\\nFriday was a special day in Plymouth.

Since Cathy can't pass up coupons, garage sales or anything free in general, she loaded up the girls and took them to [Plimoth Plantation](http://www.plimoth.org/) while I worked.

We spent our first week in [Falmouth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falmouth,_Massachusetts) (our new favorite city), then went further out onto the Cape to [Brewster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster,_Massachusetts) for four days and then back to Falmouth for a week.\\n\\nWe started off by making the mistake of traveling to Falmouth on the first day of school so that put us behind right away. The first two weeks of virtual school were a frustrating and emotional experience for everyone (except Alexis). K-12 was horrible. We spent most of our time struggling with their crappy website and trying to find the lesson materials in the numerous boxes of stuff they sent us for \\\"virtual school\\\". Alexis did great but Hali cried almost every day doing math and Kira was lost on most subjects besides reading. The kids had to attend boring webinars, unscramble confusing instructions and redo work that was required both offline and online. Cathy was angry, frustrated and frazzled most of these two weeks. We talked a number of times about ending our trip and heading back home. It was that bad. We just couldn't take the stress of K-12. However, we decided to listen to the advice of our K-12 advisor and take a couple of weeks to learn the system. After the initial shock of K-12 it became nearly bearable.\\n\\n![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3863/15055570190_0910719af9_c.jpg)\\n\\nMost of first week at Sippewissett Campground was spent trying to survive K-12. We started school around 8am and didn't finish up till 4/5pm each day. We typically went out for dinner and (multiple) drinks in [Woods Hole](http://www.woodshole.com) each night as everyone needed a break from home. Everyone was exhausted both mentally and physically.\\n\\nThe highlight of our time at Sippewissett was the 12 mile bike path at the edge of the campground that went all the way path Falmouth and into Woods Hole. I rode my Tri bike a couple of times in the morning and we hooked up Kira's tagalong bike to Cathy's folding bike. We took a number of trips into Falmouth/Woods Hole to burn off steam. [Make sure to watch this great video.](https://flic.kr/p/pdSusN)\\n\\n![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3922/15239145061_7d8b2b812c_c.jpg)\\n\\nLexi's first real bike trip was Thursday after school and she rode 7.5 miles like a boss! Towards the end of our trip we stopped at Seafood Sam's for a bite to eat as their brilliant marketing department placed a bike rack along the bike path. It was conveniently located about a mile from our campground and had great food and beer so we made it a very frequent stop for lunch, dinner and snacks.\\n\\n![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3911/15239144061_180dbfa317_b.jpg)\\n\\nAfter school on Friday, we all dried our tears, took deep breaths and headed an hour down the Cape to Hyannis to check it out. We were not fans of Hyannis at all. It just felt like a large, grungy city; not like our beautiful, quaint Falmouth. We strolled up and down the \\\"downtown\\\", stopped for some ice cream, spent some money at a little arcade and capped off our stay with some appetizers and beer. Not impressed at all.\\n\\n![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15219219106_4d30a8502d_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe got up early Saturday and caught the 10:30am Ferry to Martha's Vineyard! What a great time!! The Ferry ride was fun and we talked with a family that had adopted two little black girls and were heading to their mother's house on the island. We arrived in Vineyard Haven and purchased tickets to take the bus around the island. \\n\\nOur first stop was the city of Oak Bluff only a few minutes away. It had a nice little downtown and there were signs all over welcoming the Obamas (they had just left the island the day before). Our goal was to visit the [Gingerbread Houses](https://www.google.com/search?q=oaks+bluff+gingerbread+houses&espv=2&biw=1186&bih=636&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=pToxVJ-bAoyWyATdiIK4Bg&ved=0CCgQ7Ak) but first we wandered around the entire town (took all of 20 minutes!), down by the water and then headed for lunch. I found the local brewery, [Offshore Ale Company](http://www.offshoreale.com/), and we stopped a bite. The food, beer and atmosphere was fantastic! I could have stayed there all day but I had to appease the girls with tiny houses.\\n\\n![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3907/15055464659_97a0b41f82_c.jpg)\\n\\nSo off we went again in search of the famed \\\"Gingerbread Houses\\\". There were actually quite awesome with blocks and blocks of tiny, quirky, brightly painted houses. We had a blast walking down the narrow streets and talking with the owners. \\n\\nAfter wandering around for awhile we hopped on the bus and headed to Menemsha on the southern part of the island to watch the sunset on the beach. There wasn't much to Menemsha; a couple of tourist shops, one overpriced restaurant and a working fishing dock. We thought about buying some seafood at one of the local fishing shops (the lobsters were the size of small children!) but it was too cold to eat outside. We ended up at the overpriced, BYOB restaurant. \\n\\n![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3917/15239129151_806be91b24_c.jpg)\\n\\nThe highlight of the evening was watching the girls play on the rocks at the beach and watching the sun set. Interesting side-note, people in Mass clap during the setting sun the same as they do in Sarasota. Perhaps... it's their clapping that actually makes the sun set and not the other way around? Afterwards we boarded the various buses to take us back to the Ferry and made the hour ride back to Woods Hole. We had taken the campground shuttle to the Ferry that morning and intended to simply catch a cab back to the campground. However, when we arrived back on the mainland, there were no taxis to be found. We ended up waiting about 45 minutes in the cold for a cab to arrive. Nevertheless, we ended up pouring three very tired girls into bed late.\\n\\nSince everyone was tired from Martha's Vineyard, we stay around the campground Sunday doing chores and getting ready for school the next day. We did hook up the bikes and ride into Falmouth to our favorite Irish pub (Liam Maguire's) for lunch. A lazy day but a good time to recharge before our move down the Cape to Brewster the next day.\\n\\n![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5553/15055426479_a2bd61ecdb_c.jpg)\\n\\nMonday we left Sippewissett and headed an hour down the Cape to Sweetwater Forest Campground. We lucked out with a double-sized spot, in range of the wifi and in the middle of the forest. Beautiful campground! We spent the rest of the day plodding through K-12 and then headed into Orleans (the little city next door) to see what there was to do. We ended up stopping at the [Land Ho!](http://www.land-ho.com/) pub & restaurant which was very popular with locals and tourists, even in the off season. We waited outside for about 30 minutes and the girls made friends with an elderly black couple. We ended up sitting next to them for dinner and the girls told them our story. All of it. They loved the girls so much that they bought each one of them dessert! We ended up going back to Land Ho! a couple of times (again breaking our \\\"only eat at a place once\\\" rule) for the beer and Kale soup (#awesome!!).\\n\\n![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3907/15242117195_1d453acf4b_c.jpg)\\n\\nSchool as usual Tuesday, and then Wednesday we left mid-afternoon and drove an hour out to the very end of the Cape to [Provincetown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincetown,_Massachusetts). It was \\\"fabuuuullooouus\\\"! We wandered around the pier and eventually made our way to the [Pilgrim Monument](http://www.pilgrim-monument.org/) to learn about the history of the city and it's impact as the whaling capital of New England. Afterwards it was dinner time and we got suckered into a poor choice for dinner on the water.\\n\\nFriday we packed up and headed back to Sippewissett. Cathy was flying back to Sarasota on Tuesday for doctor's appointments with Kira and Hali and I wanted to be somewhere familiar so I wouldn't have to work, teach Lexi and figure out what was going on around me. Plus, we absolutely love the location and people at Sippewissett!! \\n\\n![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5565/15241665262_964441c456_c.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday and Sunday were spent hanging around the campsite and riding bikes into Falmouth a number of times. The campground had their annual Labor Day party Sunday evening complete with karaoke. There were plenty of little girls running around the campground so they were having a blast singing together in groups. Alexis was the first to step up and sing by herself! She definitely loves the spotlight and ended up singing a number of times. Hali and Kira even sang as part of a group for a couple of songs! We were told by the owners that Cathy and I did the best rendition of \\\"Love Shack\\\" they had ever heard. No surprise there.\\n\\nMonday was Labor Day and Cathy and the girls were flying out of Boston **early** the next morning. We found a hotel near the airport and everyone was excited to spend the night in a real bed!! We just laid around the room watching TV and eating pizza. I even went out and got a massage!\\n\\nWe got up at 5am the next morning and dropped the girls off at the airport and then Lexi and I headed back to Falmouth. Not a bad trip as we missed most of the traffic. Lexi and I ate out most of the time (actually all the time) and just hung out together. We watched a lot of movies, went to the playground and did our various jobs. On Friday, Lexi helped me pack up and we headed to our next site Foxborough, MA!\\n\\nCathy spent her time in Sarasota staying with Mike and Gena. Most of her days were spent at Doctor's appointments, doing school work in random locations and visiting family and friends. \\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157647199049017%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157647199049017%2F&set_id=72157647199049017&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157647199049017%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157647199049017%2F&set_id=72157647199049017&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: August 18 - August 25   \\nRV Park: [Sippewissett Campground](https://sippewissett.com), Falmouth, MA\\n\\nDates: August 25 - August 29  \\nRV Park: [Sweetwater Forest](http://www.sweetwaterforest.com), Brewster, MA\\n\\nDates: August 29 - September 5  \\nRV Park: [Sippewissett Campground](https://sippewissett.com), Falmouth, MA\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We had a fantastic three weeks in Cape Code but it was soured by our experience with <a href=\"http://www.k12.com/\">K-12</a> virtual schooling.

We started school around 8am and didn't finish up till 4/5pm each day. We typically went out for dinner and (multiple) drinks in <a href=\"http://www.woodshole.com\">Woods Hole</a> each night as everyone needed a break from home. Everyone was exhausted both mentally and physically.</p>\n<p>The highlight of our time at Sippewissett was the 12 mile bike path at the edge of the campground that went all the way path Falmouth and into Woods Hole. I rode my Tri bike a couple of times in the morning and we hooked up Kira's tagalong bike to Cathy's folding bike. We took a number of trips into Falmouth/Woods Hole to burn off steam. <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/pdSusN\">Make sure to watch this great video.</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3922/15239145061_7d8b2b812c_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Lexi's first real bike trip was Thursday after school and she rode 7.5 miles like a boss! Towards the end of our trip we stopped at Seafood Sam's for a bite to eat as their brilliant marketing department placed a bike rack along the bike path. It was conveniently located about a mile from our campground and had great food and beer so we made it a very frequent stop for lunch, dinner and snacks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3911/15239144061_180dbfa317_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>After school on Friday, we all dried our tears, took deep breaths and headed an hour down the Cape to Hyannis to check it out. We were not fans of Hyannis at all. It just felt like a large, grungy city; not like our beautiful, quaint Falmouth. We strolled up and down the &quot;downtown&quot;, stopped for some ice cream, spent some money at a little arcade and capped off our stay with some appetizers and beer. Not impressed at all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/15219219106_4d30a8502d_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>We got up early Saturday and caught the 10:30am Ferry to Martha's Vineyard! What a great time!! The Ferry ride was fun and we talked with a family that had adopted two little black girls and were heading to their mother's house on the island. We arrived in Vineyard Haven and purchased tickets to take the bus around the island.</p>\n<p>Our first stop was the city of Oak Bluff only a few minutes away. It had a nice little downtown and there were signs all over welcoming the Obamas (they had just left the island the day before). Our goal was to visit the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=oaks+bluff+gingerbread+houses&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1186&amp;bih=636&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pToxVJ-bAoyWyATdiIK4Bg&amp;ved=0CCgQ7Ak\">Gingerbread Houses</a> but first we wandered around the entire town (took all of 20 minutes!), down by the water and then headed for lunch. I found the local brewery, <a href=\"http://www.offshoreale.com/\">Offshore Ale Company</a>, and we stopped a bite. The food, beer and atmosphere was fantastic! I could have stayed there all day but I had to appease the girls with tiny houses.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3907/15055464659_97a0b41f82_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>So off we went again in search of the famed &quot;Gingerbread Houses&quot;. There were actually quite awesome with blocks and blocks of tiny, quirky, brightly painted houses. We had a blast walking down the narrow streets and talking with the owners.</p>\n<p>After wandering around for awhile we hopped on the bus and headed to Menemsha on the southern part of the island to watch the sunset on the beach. There wasn't much to Menemsha; a couple of tourist shops, one overpriced restaurant and a working fishing dock. We thought about buying some seafood at one of the local fishing shops (the lobsters were the size of small children!) but it was too cold to eat outside. We ended up at the overpriced, BYOB restaurant.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3917/15239129151_806be91b24_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>The highlight of the evening was watching the girls play on the rocks at the beach and watching the sun set. Interesting side-note, people in Mass clap during the setting sun the same as they do in Sarasota. Perhaps... it's their clapping that actually makes the sun set and not the other way around? Afterwards we boarded the various buses to take us back to the Ferry and made the hour ride back to Woods Hole. We had taken the campground shuttle to the Ferry that morning and intended to simply catch a cab back to the campground. However, when we arrived back on the mainland, there were no taxis to be found. We ended up waiting about 45 minutes in the cold for a cab to arrive. Nevertheless, we ended up pouring three very tired girls into bed late.</p>\n<p>Since everyone was tired from Martha's Vineyard, we stay around the campground Sunday doing chores and getting ready for school the next day. We did hook up the bikes and ride into Falmouth to our favorite Irish pub (Liam Maguire's) for lunch. A lazy day but a good time to recharge before our move down the Cape to Brewster the next day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5553/15055426479_a2bd61ecdb_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Monday we left Sippewissett and headed an hour down the Cape to Sweetwater Forest Campground. We lucked out with a double-sized spot, in range of the wifi and in the middle of the forest. Beautiful campground! We spent the rest of the day plodding through K-12 and then headed into Orleans (the little city next door) to see what there was to do. We ended up stopping at the <a href=\"http://www.land-ho.com/\">Land Ho!</a> pub &amp; restaurant which was very popular with locals and tourists, even in the off season. We waited outside for about 30 minutes and the girls made friends with an elderly black couple. We ended up sitting next to them for dinner and the girls told them our story. All of it. They loved the girls so much that they bought each one of them dessert! We ended up going back to Land Ho! a couple of times (again breaking our &quot;only eat at a place once&quot; rule) for the beer and Kale soup (#awesome!!).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3907/15242117195_1d453acf4b_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>School as usual Tuesday, and then Wednesday we left mid-afternoon and drove an hour out to the very end of the Cape to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincetown,_Massachusetts\">Provincetown</a>. It was &quot;fabuuuullooouus&quot;! We wandered around the pier and eventually made our way to the <a href=\"http://www.pilgrim-monument.org/\">Pilgrim Monument</a> to learn about the history of the city and it's impact as the whaling capital of New England. Afterwards it was dinner time and we got suckered into a poor choice for dinner on the water.</p>\n<p>Friday we packed up and headed back to Sippewissett. Cathy was flying back to Sarasota on Tuesday for doctor's appointments with Kira and Hali and I wanted to be somewhere familiar so I wouldn't have to work, teach Lexi and figure out what was going on around me. Plus, we absolutely love the location and people at Sippewissett!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5565/15241665262_964441c456_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Saturday and Sunday were spent hanging around the campsite and riding bikes into Falmouth a number of times. The campground had their annual Labor Day party Sunday evening complete with karaoke. There were plenty of little girls running around the campground so they were having a blast singing together in groups. Alexis was the first to step up and sing by herself! She definitely loves the spotlight and ended up singing a number of times. Hali and Kira even sang as part of a group for a couple of songs! We were told by the owners that Cathy and I did the best rendition of &quot;Love Shack&quot; they had ever heard. No surprise there.</p>\n<p>Monday was Labor Day and Cathy and the girls were flying out of Boston <strong>early</strong> the next morning. We found a hotel near the airport and everyone was excited to spend the night in a real bed!! We just laid around the room watching TV and eating pizza. I even went out and got a massage!</p>\n<p>We got up at 5am the next morning and dropped the girls off at the airport and then Lexi and I headed back to Falmouth. Not a bad trip as we missed most of the traffic. Lexi and I ate out most of the time (actually all the time) and just hung out together. We watched a lot of movies, went to the playground and did our various jobs. On Friday, Lexi helped me pack up and we headed to our next site Foxborough, MA!</p>\n<p>Cathy spent her time in Sarasota staying with Mike and Gena.

Alexis did great but Hali cried almost every\nday doing math and Kira was lost on most subjects besides reading. The kids had\nto attend boring webinars, unscramble confusing instructions and redo work that\nwas required both offline and online. Cathy was angry, frustrated and frazzled\nmost of these two weeks.

You gotta go to Normandy Farms in Foxborough, MA!!\\\". So we finally broke down and gave into the \\\"camping peer pressure\\\" and booked some time at Normandy Farms. \\n\\nThe campground (if you can call it that) is very nice and somewhat \\\"corporate\\\". If feels a little like Disney (with similar prices) where everything is immaculate and very well taken care of. That's not a bad thing, but you don't run into campgrounds like this too often. They have 4 pools, a hot tub, a ton of playgrounds, a rec hall and a \\\"campers kitchen\\\" run by a local restaurant. The staff is **super** nice and we had many long conversations with them. I would definitely say there again.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15448349995_3d92679e6b_k.jpg)\\n\\nLexi and I pulled into the campground Friday a little after 1pm and checked in. Normandy is absolutely packed on the weekends and rather empty during the week. We had booked a couple of days before so we got a spot waaayyy in the back in the overflow lot. After we got our school work done we headed to the pool. Lexi made friends as usual with the girl who was parked next door. Unfortunately, I talked to the front desk a little later and we ended up moving to a better spot next to the pool so she didn't see her friend as much!\\n\\nFriday night the Camper's Kitchen was offering an \\\"Authentic New England Clam Bake\\\" so I decided to purchase one. The lobster was good but I found out that I'm not fond of clams or mussels at all. I would have been much happier with a $25 steak instead but it was worth the experience.\\n\\nSaturday and Sunday were crazy at the park!! It was completely packed and felt like 1.65M people were there. Lexi made friends with a little girl named Olivia who was there with her brother, dad and her dad's friend. I ended up hanging out with them for the weekend as well! YAH! Friends for me! We spent most of the weekend at the pool, playgrounds and playing with toys. They had a dance Saturday evening and Lexi put on her \\\"adoption\\\" dress and went to town. There were a ton of little girls for her to play with and she had a blast. \\n\\nSunday morning we went over and had breakfast at the Camper's Kitchen (we ate there quite often since mom was away) and said goodbye to her friends. Since it was Sunday and people were heading home for the weekend, I spoke with the front desk and got another, better site in the trees! We moved the campsite and spent the rest of the day hanging out at the pool. Not as many kids and a little boring for poor little Lexi.\\n\\nCathy and the girls were flying back late Monday night so we did our work and left late in the evening for Boston. The girls landed around 11pm and then we tried to drive home. Unfortunately there was construction around the airport and we ended going around in circles trying to get on the highway. Literally (not figuratively) in circles... three times around the same detour path. Around 12:30am we finally got onto the highway. Along the way Cathy and I talked about taking the girls out of K-12 and enroll them into home schooling. In the end, we decided to do [Time4Learning](http://www.time4learning.com/).\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15445206611_17e20456fe_k.jpg)\\n\\nTuesday we started our first day of Time4Learning and **life was muuuccchhhh better**. Everything is online and Cathy can configure their courses suited to their ability. For instance, if one girl is strong in math and weak reading, she can dial the math curriculum up and the reading curriculum down. All of the lessons feel like games and the girls really enjoy going through them. It made learning fun again! We spent most of Tuesday in the lodge doing school work and afterwards celebrated by having dinner at the local Irish pub where we played trivia. Cathy was much happier (see smiling photo above) and back to her ole' self again: pleasant, patient and beautiful.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15261657180_9170e701aa_k.jpg)\\n\\nWednesday was an awesome day!! Hali and I had been trying to go to a Red Sox game for awhile but seemed to always be traveling farther and farther away from Boston. Wednesday was the last time we could take in a game was we were heading north and the Sox were going on the road. We took off around noon for Boston and arrived during the second inning. We finally found a parking space and headed to the Fenway. I asked a security guard where I could purchase tickets and he promptly pulled out his wallet and gave me two free tickets. Apparently the Red Sox are so bad this year that they are giving away tickets!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15261753428_0bc01aaf57_h.jpg)\\n\\nOur seats were right past first base and about 30 rows up. Great seats for free! The Sox were down 6-0 in the third inning but we didn't care. We had a blast just sitting there watching the game, talking about baseball and the park and eating Fenway franks. The game finished around 4:30pm and we hit the road with everyone else trying to get out of Boston. Later, Hali said it was one of the best days of her life. I had to agree as well. I always love spending time alone with Hali. She's such a great girl.\\n\\nOn the way home we stopped at a nearby Sport Authority for a new mountain bike for me. I had given up the hope of riding my Tri bike and had decided to ship it back home. It just wasn't practical and I wanted something to attach Kira's tagalong to. Cathy's folding bike just didn't do the trick.\\n\\nThursday was RV repair day. We had some nagging issues so I had made arrangements to drop it off for some work. We came back to the campgrounds for some school work and then hit Toby Keith's \\\"I love this bar\\\" restaurant for lunch. Really good!!! After lunch we finished our work and picked up the RV. That evening we went to the Bass Pro Shop as the \\\"Cranberry Bogs\\\" were right behind it. No cranberries to see but plenty of learning about agriculture in general.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15261580539_fb4d8678d3_k.jpg)\\n\\nFriday we finished school and work, Cathy got a massage and then we took off for Boston around 3:30pm. We had decided to head to the north end for pizza and some sightseeing. We would have liked to have done the Freedom Trail but just didn't have enough time. We pulled into the north end and immediately hit [Regina Pizzeria](http://www.pizzeriaregina.com/) (since 1926!) for dinner. It was 5:01pm so the girls were dying!! The pizza and hole-in-the-wall atmosphere were perfect!! Great time.\\n\\nEven though we didn't have time for the Freedom Trail, we made plans for some historical sightseeing. Our first (and last) stop was Paul Revere's house. At that point, Cathy promptly broke her sandals on the cobblestone streets. We spent the next half hour searching for a way to fix her shoe to no avail.  So we grabbed some coffee and treats at a small coffee shop on the way out of town and headed back home. Boston has punched us right square in the mouth.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15261705360_3c9ad23d39_k.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday was \\\"all history all the time\\\" day as we headed to Lexington and Concord!! We took a 2 hour tour around both cities, stopping at local battle sites and talking about the Revolution and how it began. The girls were a little bored at first (I was having a blast!!!) but soon got into the swing of things as we made stops and history came to life.

They have 4 pools, a hot tub, a ton of playgrounds, a rec hall and a &quot;campers kitchen&quot; run by a local restaurant. The staff is <strong>super</strong> nice and we had many long conversations with them. I would definitely say there again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15448349995_3d92679e6b_k.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Lexi and I pulled into the campground Friday a little after 1pm and checked in. Normandy is absolutely packed on the weekends and rather empty during the week. We had booked a couple of days before so we got a spot waaayyy in the back in the overflow lot. After we got our school work done we headed to the pool. Lexi made friends as usual with the girl who was parked next door. Unfortunately, I talked to the front desk a little later and we ended up moving to a better spot next to the pool so she didn't see her friend as much!</p>\n<p>Friday night the Camper's Kitchen was offering an &quot;Authentic New England Clam Bake&quot; so I decided to purchase one. The lobster was good but I found out that I'm not fond of clams or mussels at all. I would have been much happier with a $25 steak instead but it was worth the experience.</p>\n<p>Saturday and Sunday were crazy at the park!! It was completely packed and felt like 1.65M people were there. Lexi made friends with a little girl named Olivia who was there with her brother, dad and her dad's friend. I ended up hanging out with them for the weekend as well! YAH! Friends for me! We spent most of the weekend at the pool, playgrounds and playing with toys. They had a dance Saturday evening and Lexi put on her &quot;adoption&quot; dress and went to town. There were a ton of little girls for her to play with and she had a blast.</p>\n<p>Sunday morning we went over and had breakfast at the Camper's Kitchen (we ate there quite often since mom was away) and said goodbye to her friends. Since it was Sunday and people were heading home for the weekend, I spoke with the front desk and got another, better site in the trees! We moved the campsite and spent the rest of the day hanging out at the pool. Not as many kids and a little boring for poor little Lexi.</p>\n<p>Cathy and the girls were flying back late Monday night so we did our work and left late in the evening for Boston. The girls landed around 11pm and then we tried to drive home. Unfortunately there was construction around the airport and we ended going around in circles trying to get on the highway. Literally (not figuratively) in circles... three times around the same detour path. Around 12:30am we finally got onto the highway. Along the way Cathy and I talked about taking the girls out of K-12 and enroll them into home schooling. In the end, we decided to do <a href=\"http://www.time4learning.com/\">Time4Learning</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15445206611_17e20456fe_k.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Tuesday we started our first day of Time4Learning and <strong>life was muuuccchhhh better</strong>. Everything is online and Cathy can configure their courses suited to their ability. For instance, if one girl is strong in math and weak reading, she can dial the math curriculum up and the reading curriculum down. All of the lessons feel like games and the girls really enjoy going through them. It made learning fun again! We spent most of Tuesday in the lodge doing school work and afterwards celebrated by having dinner at the local Irish pub where we played trivia. Cathy was much happier (see smiling photo above) and back to her ole' self again: pleasant, patient and beautiful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15261657180_9170e701aa_k.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Wednesday was an awesome day!! Hali and I had been trying to go to a Red Sox game for awhile but seemed to always be traveling farther and farther away from Boston. Wednesday was the last time we could take in a game was we were heading north and the Sox were going on the road. We took off around noon for Boston and arrived during the second inning. We finally found a parking space and headed to the Fenway. I asked a security guard where I could purchase tickets and he promptly pulled out his wallet and gave me two free tickets. Apparently the Red Sox are so bad this year that they are giving away tickets!</p>\n<p><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15261753428_0bc01aaf57_h.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Our seats were right past first base and about 30 rows up. Great seats for free! The Sox were down 6-0 in the third inning but we didn't care. We had a blast just sitting there watching the game, talking about baseball and the park and eating Fenway franks. The game finished around 4:30pm and we hit the road with everyone else trying to get out of Boston. Later, Hali said it was one of the best days of her life. I had to agree as well. I always love spending time alone with Hali. She's such a great girl.</p>\n<p>On the way home we stopped at a nearby Sport Authority for a new mountain bike for me. I had given up the hope of riding my Tri bike and had decided to ship it back home. It just wasn't practical and I wanted something to attach Kira's tagalong to. Cathy's folding bike just didn't do the trick.</p>\n<p>Thursday was RV repair day. We had some nagging issues so I had made arrangements to drop it off for some work. We came back to the campgrounds for some school work and then hit Toby Keith's &quot;I love this bar&quot; restaurant for lunch. Really good!!! After lunch we finished our work and picked up the RV. That evening we went to the Bass Pro Shop as the &quot;Cranberry Bogs&quot; were right behind it. No cranberries to see but plenty of learning about agriculture in general.</p>\n<p><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/10/15261580539_fb4d8678d3_k.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Friday we finished school and work, Cathy got a massage and then we took off for Boston around 3:30pm. We had decided to head to the north end for pizza and some sightseeing. We would have liked to have done the Freedom Trail but just didn't have enough time. We pulled into the north end and immediately hit <a href=\"http://www.pizzeriaregina.com/\">Regina Pizzeria</a> (since 1926!) for dinner. It was 5:01pm so the girls were dying!! The pizza and hole-in-the-wall atmosphere were perfect!! Great time.</p>\n<p>Even though we didn't have time for the Freedom Trail, we made plans for some historical sightseeing. Our first (and last) stop was Paul Revere's house. At that point, Cathy promptly broke her sandals on the cobblestone streets. We spent the next half hour searching for a way to fix her shoe to no avail.  So we grabbed some coffee and treats at a small coffee shop on the way out of town and headed back home.

Our friend Tanya had promised that she could find us a babysitter in Bar Harbor and we thought, \\\"Heck ya! We'll drive 6 hours round trip for a night out sans kids!\\\".\\n\\nHowever, before heading to Maine I had to make a trip to Indianapolis for some iOS training so we thought that New Hampshire would be a good place for Cathy and the girls to hang out. Plus.. it's a long way to Maine!!\\n\\nOur first stop was right over the Massachusetts border in Hampton Falls, NH. When Cathy booked the spot we thought it looked a little touristy like Atlantic City. However, we soon learned that it was a much less glamorous and rundown version of Atlantic City. I'm not sure if it was the cold, dreary weather or just the fact that season was over, but Hampton Falls was **definitely** not a place we wanted to hang out in for very long.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-16-09-05-23.jpg)\\n\\nLuckily our spot at Wakeda Campground was awesome!  After getting everything set up, we finished school and work and then left to scout out Hampton Falls. Our search for a cool place to eat did not bear fruit down by the water and we ended up finding \\\"Mexico Lindo\\\" in the next town over after an hour or so of searching. We never went back to Hampton Falls again and that was enough for Cathy.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-17-17-37-28.jpg)\\n\\nWe stayed around the campground Tuesday and Wednesday, doing work, running and generally having some down time. After school Wednesday Cathy decided that we were in desperate need of some apple picking before dinner. So we found a cool farmer's market with an orchard down the road and had a blast picking, eating and generally fooling around with apples. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-17-17-54-29.jpg)\\n\\nThe apples were delicious and we brought a sack home for the girls to eat for next couple of weeks. After that, it was dinner time but everyone was nearly stuffed with apples! However, our quest is to eat our way across America so we did our best to find a cool little pub and get the girls some dessert and us some beer. Our quest was successful and we poured the girls into bed overflowing with apples and chocolate cake. We stress proper nutrition with our girls. It's important.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-18-20-45-31.jpg)\\n\\nThursday was our last full day at Wakeda and we decided to do something special so... we surprised the girls by taking them to the movies!! We'd had a hard day with work and studying and the girls really wanted to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so it sounded like something fun to do. We found a local cinema (it was nearly empty!) and had a blast watching the movie and dancing afterwards in front of the big screen. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-19-12-11-14.jpg)\\n\\nOn Friday we pulled out and drove roughly two hours north to Alton which was situated squarely in the middle of nowhere. We picked Alton as it was close to both the Manchester and Portland airports where I was flying out of and into, respectively. We pulled into Turtle Kraal RV Park around 11am, got unpacked and then headed to Manchester for my 3pm flight. Cathy and the girls cried most of the way back but made a quick stop at Camping World for a new bendable shower curtain. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-20-17-14-40.jpg)\\n\\nMost of my time in Indy was boring (except for the drinking and stealing of bar paraphernalia) but Cathy and the girls partied while I was gone. Saturday was Salem day!! The girls left for Salem shortly after the mid-morning snack. After arriving and having lunch they hit the Witch Museum. Kira was totally freaked out by the exhibits and Hali followed her to \\\"scaredy-cat-town\\\" shortly thereafter. After a trolley ride around the city and looking at spooky things (haunted campgrounds, Dead Horse Beach, etc) they had a quick dinner at the Village Tavern and headed home.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-22-13-37-03.jpg)\\n\\nMy absence and the trip to Salem had taken a toll on everyone and she became ill for the next few days. Sunday, Monday and Tuesday were down days as Cathy was feeling horrible and soon afterwards Kira and Hali fell ill as well. The girls made a fort outside and did school work by themselves while mommy lounged around the RV and tried not to die. Wednesday everyone felt a little better and they went for a hike after school in the beautiful NH weather. Unfortunately Alton was in the middle of nowhere but it was gorgeous!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-25-14-45-41.jpg)\\n\\nThursday was a fun day for the girls. After finishing school around 1pm they took off for [Castle in the Clouds](http://www.castleintheclouds.org/). On the way up the stopped by the \\\"Pebble\\\" (aka a giant rock) and hiked up the path. Kira was nervous about the walk but did a great job. She's becoming more confident as we drag her up and down mountains and valleys. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-25-16-49-13.jpg)\\n\\nThe castle was a lot of fun and the girls participated in a scavenger hunt for prizes. After hanging out in the castle for a couple of hours the girls decided they didn't want to go out for dinner and just headed back to the RV for a quick bite and then bed. \\n\\nFriday was a big day as I was returning home from Indy. I always enjoy returning from a trip as everyone is so excited to see me! The girls did their school work in the Jeep as Cathy drove the two hours to Portland to fetch me. I arrived around noon so we set out for lunch. We finally found an Irish pub down but the water after a jaunt around downtown Portland.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-26-14-24-52.jpg)\\n\\nOne of my favorite beers, [Allagash](http://www.allagash.com) White, is brewed in Portland just outside of town so we headed over for a tour of the brewery and some tasting adult beverages. The girls **love** touring breweries (as evident from the photo above) and so do I! Hali wants to brew beer with me when we return to Sarasota. She's my new beer-brewing-computer-nerd buddy!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-26-16-45-14.jpg)\\n\\nAfter being steep in brewing culture, we decided to get the girls some more \\\"good learning\\\". Apparently one of the \\\"don't miss\\\" spots in Portland is the [Victoria Mansion](http://www.victoriamansion.org/). We were the last group to go through that day and we spent about an hour touring the home that was built in the late 1850s.

After an hour or so we got everything straightened out and headed 3.5 hours north to Bar Harbor. The drive was gorgeous!! Hills, trees, mountains... everything we don't have in FL.\\n\\nWe arrived around 4pm, checked into the campground and asked for recommendations on where to get \\\"lobsta\\\" the size of a small child.

You get to pick out your lobsters and they cook them outside near the road right in front of you. The girls had PBJ and clam chowda and Cathy and I had lobstas! After that we made a quick trip through Bar Harbor to scout it out for the next couple of days. We stopped in a small pub for ice cream and drinks and Cathy had her first Mead. Not impressed. We went back, put the kids to bed and then got a late night call from Brittany. \\n\\nSunday we got up and walked down to the end of the RV park to \\\"Mainely Meat\\\" for breakfast which served almost nothing but meat dishes. We ended up eating there a couple of times as everyone loved the bacon. \\n\\nFor the rest of the morning the girls played on the playground, we did some laundry and Cathy and I took a walk down the hillside overlooking the water. We thought about leaving the girls, stealing a boat and sailing away forever but Cathy would miss her electric heaters.\\n\\nThe weather Sunday was absolutely gorgeous (65 and sunny) so we decided to spend the day outside at [Acadia National Park](http://www.nps.gov/acad/index.htm). OMG!! What a huge, gorgeous park. It takes an hour or two just to drive through it.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-28-15-44-12.jpg)\\n\\nWe spent an hour or so at Sand Beach and let the girls run around the beach (literally) while Cathy and I took a stroll. It was a lovely beach nestled in quaint bay but a little windy for us (I mean Cathy). I imagine the beach is beautiful during the summer. We contemplated coming out the next day while the girls did their school work, unfortunately we discovered our Verizon signal was nearly non-existent.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-28-16-02-58.jpg)\\n\\nOur next stop was a few miles down the road at Thunder Hole. Apparently the water comes shooting out of the hole above and makes a \\\"thunderous\\\" noise. Unfortunately the tide was out when we got there but we had a great time walking around the rocks and looking at the (awesome) water.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\\"//player.vimeo.com/video/110742929\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"281\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nOur next adventure was the highlight of our day: Gorham Mountain. It was a one mile hike to the top of the mountain (approximately 500ft above sea level) and should have only taken us 15-20 minutes to do the entire round trip. However, given the speed at which the girls climb mountains, it ended up being over an hour long. But! Everyone agreed that the view from the top was well worth the effort. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-28-16-18-31.jpg)\\n\\nKira had some issues at first with the rocks, uneven surfaces and climbing in general but she soon gained some confidence and was hopping around some rocks by the end of the trip. Hali and Lexi were billy goats. We had to tell them to wait up for us a couple of times as they would disappear.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-28-17-04-04.jpg)\\n\\nEveryone was exhaused and hungry when we got back into the Jeep so we headed into Bar Harbor for some grub. We finally settled on Paddy's Irish Pub which was pretty good. We capped the night off with some ice cream and then headed back to the RV for bed.\\n\\nMonday was school and work again but we were looking forward to the evening. We had driven three hours to Bar Harbor because our friend Tanya told us she could find us a babysitter. We hadn't had a night out by outselves in over 100 days! I have to admit that Tanya's our awesomest friend now as she came through and hooked us up a babysitter that made \\\"RV calls\\\". \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-29-17-59-45.jpg)\\n\\nWe ordered pizza for the girls and took off as fast as we could after she arrived. Our goal was to hit Bar Harbor to do some bar hopping and eat and drink in as many places as possible. I think in total we stopped in 6 or so different \\\"establishments\\\". What an awesome time! We met so many people from Sarasota in little Bar Harbor! We eventually found out that a number of businesses is the city also own restaurants and hotels in Sarasota (Longboat Beach Club for instance) and their employees simply move back and forth during seasons. Apparently Bar Harbor is only open for six months out of the year. Apparently no one wants to vacation there in January.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/2014-09-30-17-11-52.jpg)\\n\\nTuesday was our last day in Maine and the weather had gone from beautiful to cold, cloudy and dreary. After the girls finished school I took the rest of the day off and we headed back to Mainely Meat for lunch before taking off for Acadia National Park again. Our goal for the day was to drive up to Cadillac Mountain to see the sights but the weather didn't cooperate. By the time we got to the top it was too foggy to see anything. So we bought a carton of water (yes, a carton of water) and headed back into town. Bummer.\\n\\nWe grabbed dinner at Geddy's, bought some souvineers and then headed back to the RV.

After an hour or so we got\neverything straightened out and headed 3.5 hours north to Bar Harbor. The drive\nwas gorgeous!! Hills, trees, mountains... everything we don't have in FL.\n\nWe arrived around 4pm, checked into the campground and asked for recommendations\non where to get \"lobsta\" the size of a small child. Everyone was super nice and\nour spot at the campground was on the side of the hill just over crest, looking\nover the water. Beautiful view!!\n\n\n\nWe took their recommendation and went to the Trenton Bridge Lobster Pound for\ndinner. So much fun! You get to pick out your lobsters and they cook them\noutside near the road right in front of you. The girls had PBJ and clam chowda\nand Cathy and I had lobstas!

Cathy and I ran in the morning and then we finished our school work before heading over to Graceland for our tour around 4pm. The tour came with a super cool interactive iPad that takes you through each room and provides narration, music and context specific videos. It was well worth the small extra price.

Life could be worse. Dinner was again great and we all shared a \\\"Krispy Kreme Bananas Foster\\\" for dessert. It's exactly as it sounds. We weren't as full this time so we headed back home and decided to watch another Elvis movie.

Tuesday was Cathy's mom birthday who had died 12 or so years ago. Each year on her birthday everyong gets together and celebrates with her favorite drink, CC&7. Nancy was a huge Elvis fan so it was a perfect coincidence that we were at Graceland on her birthday.

The next one left in about 25 minutes (noon) so we thought we'd get a super quick bite to eat for the girls next door at the [Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery](http://www.rockbottom.com/). Well, once again our plans went all ass over teakettle as the food was awesome, they brewed their own beers and they were playing the KY football game.

Some of the stuff from before the 70's were too old for us but we spent the better part of two hours walking around the three floors. They's done a good job of gamifying the tour so you sign up with you name and photo and can compete in different games to win badges to become \\\"certified country\\\". Of course, Hali spent most of her time earning badges and I struggled with Kira along the way.

We ran errands to a couple of stores and the mall (Cathy wanted some \\\"alone time\\\" with Macy's) and finally headed back into downtown Nashville.

The campground was small but OK. Everyone was nice and\nthere were some kids around for the girls to play with. It was also flat so Hali\nand I got some descent runs in. By the time we unhooked and got everything setup\nit was almost dark. It was starting to get dark around 5/6pm so it maked it feel \nlater than it actually is.\n\nWe had just purchased a space heater in Mammoth Cave a couple of days before and\nit had suddenly stopped. Since space heaters are a necessity for Cathy, we\nloaded everyone in the car and headed for Wal-Mart to exchange it. Afterwards we\nstopped at a local sports bar/restaurant on a recommendation and quickly bolted\nwhen we realized it was a smoking establishment (this is Tennessee you know!) We\nfinally wound up at the local Logan's for a nice hunk of steak.\n\n\n\nFriday was a long school and work day but we finally finished up around 4pm and\nventured into Nashville to peek around in preparation for the weekend. Nashville\nturned out to be much bigger than I had expected. I pictured it as a cool little\ntrendy town with country music singers walking around downtown but I was\nmistaken. Nashville is a big city with traffic, huge office buidings and crazy\ndrivers that almost kill you.\n\nWe didn't know where the \"cool\" parts of downtown Nashville were so we took a\nstab at it but unfortunately missed the mark by a couple of streets. We walked\naround a for awhile and finally stopped at 417 Union [http://www.417union.com] \nfor dinner. It was a little, old hole-in-the-wall restaurant with great reviews\non yelp that lived up to the hipe. They had a good selection of local brews and\nI soon learned that Nashville had a number of microbrews. +1 for Nashville!\n\nWe still weren't ready to head home yet so we asked our waiter for\nrecommendation on dessert. So we headed over to another part of town to Cafe\nCoco for dessert and coffee before calling it a night.\n\n\n\nSaturday was our big day in Nashville and we planned on taking in the sights. We\nheaded into Nashville early to take the trolly tour. Unfortunately our plans\nwent ass over teakettle when there was a marathon finishing smack center of\ndowntown. We walked around for awhile and finally found the trolly station. The\nnext one left in about 25 minutes (noon) so we thought we'd get a super quick\nbite to eat for the girls next door at the Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery\n[http://www.rockbottom.com/]. Well, once again our plans went all ass over\nteakettle as the food was awesome, they brewed their own beers and they were\nplaying the KY football game. We ended up missing the noon trolly but made the\n12:40 one. Everyone was happy though.\n\n\n\nThe trolly tour was interesting but short. We typically love trolly tours as you\nget to see a large part of the city you are in along with some historical\nbackground. There were only 10 stops or so but the only one we got off on was\nthe Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum [http://countrymusichalloffame.org/].\nEveryone had an absolute blast! Some of the stuff from before the 70's were too\nold for us but we spent the better part of two hours walking around the three\nfloors. They's done a good job of gamifying the tour so you sign up with you\nname and photo and can compete in different games to win badges to become\n\"certified country\". Of course, Hali spent most of her time earning badges and I\nstruggled with Kira along the way. She loves to push buttons and answer\nquestions without knowing what she's doing.\n\n\n\nLexi fell asleep again during the tour so she was still batting 1000% for paid\nsleeping spots whle in motion. By the end of the tour, the girls were starving\nso we had to find some food before they fadded into the pavement. One big\nproblem. Florida was playing Vandy nearby and downtown was packed with Gator\nfans. We walked around a about an hour getting more frustrated and angry with\neach restaurant's 30-45 minutes wait. Cathy wanted to find somewhere with live\nmusic but everything was packed with people wearing blue and orange. Finally,\nKira wanted pizza (as usual) so we stopped into Luigi's City Pizza and found\nthere was no wait. The girls were on death's doorstep by this point but soon\nrecovered. Afterwards we headed back home and the girls played on their\ncomputers while we watched TV.\n\n\n\nSunday was a leisurely day. We stayed around the campground riding bikes and\nthree-wheelers while the girls played with the other kids in the park. I messed\naround on my computer and helped Cathy with laundry. We ran errands to a couple\nof stores and the mall (Cathy wanted some \"alone time\" with Macy's) and finally\nheaded back into downtown Nashville. We were determined to find some place with\nlive music. We'd wandered into the Wildhorse Saloon the previous day and it\nlooked promising.\n\n\n\nThe Wildhorse Saloon [http://www.wildhorsesaloon.com/] was an absolute blast!! \nGood food, great local beer and live music. They had a local band (the lead\nsinger was from western KY), that performed an acoustic set first and then dance\nmusic. In between sets they had line dance instructions and the two little girls\nparticipated.\n\n\n\nWatch the video [http://vimeo.com/114935604]\n\nThere was a small group of guys in the corner and one was teaching the others\nhow to dance. After watching a couple of the guys go around the dance floor with\neach other, she decided that she's had enough and asked if she could cut in. She\nspent the entire song teach this young guy how to two-step.\n\n\n\nWatch the video [http://vimeo.com/114935605]\n\nWe danced for what seemed like a couple of hours till the band stopped but Cathy\nhadn't heard enough music yet. So we wandered down the street to BB Kings\nrestaurant for dessert and listen to some blues. After that is was getting late\nand the girls were getting tired so we called it a night. We were heading to\nMemphis the next day.\n\n \n\nDates: November 6 - November 10\nRV Park: Grand Ole RV Resort [http://www.grandolervresort.com/], Goodlettsville,\nTN","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/15558074888_e936ddfa57_k.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2014-11-12T17:16:57.000Z","updated_at":"2015-01-25T18:36:15.000Z","published_at":"2014-12-19T00:01:31.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f0e","uuid":"3c9509b5-fc2d-427c-8e47-5eea26ed2d2a","title":"Can't Wait to Go Back to New Hampshire!!","slug":"new-hampshire-round-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"We left Maine with a goal to get to Pittsbugh by a certain date as I was flying out for Dreamforce in SF.

The girls were not as thrilled with the water as they were with the\nleaves and we had to break up a number of leaf fights before we left. It was\nstarting to get dark and cold and Cathy hates the cold.\n\n\n\nThe ladies at the bank told us there was huge candy store (Chudders\n[http://www.chutters.com/candy/]) a couple of towns over and we promised the\ngirls we'd go take a look. After 30 minutes or so we walked out with some bags\nof candy, moustache straws and some novelty gifts. As we were walking back to\nthe Jeep, I noticed a cool little building down the alley on the water. It\nturned out to be the Schilling Beer Co. [http://www.schillingbeer.com/] that\nwe'd heard about so we stopped in for dinner. I was less than impressed with the\nentire experience. They stuck is in this little alcove isolated by ourselves,\nthe pizza wasn't thrilling and they only had a couple of beers that I liked. The\nhighlight of the evening was Lexi falling on the curb on the way out and busting\nher lip wide open.\n\n\n\nSaturday morning we were leaving New Hampshire for Vermont but we had one last\nstop to make before pulling out. Everyone had raved about \"Polly's Pancake\nParlor\" and how we \"needed\" to go. So we slept in a little later than usual, got\nup and got dressed and then headed to Polly's Pancake Parlor. I was this little\n60 year old farmhouse that had been converted to a restaurant 20 years ago. They\nmake everything from scratch, with large portions and chocked full of\nawesomeness! We waited with the other throngs of people outside for 45 minutes\nbut it was worth it. I even put a \"PPP\" sticker on the RV bumper which is\nusually reserved for Army and brewery stickers. It was that good!\n\nWe returned to Fransted just before noon, packed up and pulled out for Vermont.\nIt was a dreary day and started raining shortly after we left.\n\n \n\nDates: October 1 - October 4\nRV Park: Fransted Family Campground [http://franstedcampground.com/], Franconia,\nNH","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/11/15510949489_c416a8b9ad_k.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2014-11-12T18:43:43.000Z","updated_at":"2015-06-16T15:02:34.000Z","published_at":"2014-11-15T20:10:44.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f0f","uuid":"96746741-f1c2-4950-aae0-89dd39aa91b5","title":"2 Short Days in Vermont","slug":"2-days-in-vt","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I wish we could have spent more time in Vermont.

We essentially were on the wrong side of the road and missed the entrance by a coulple of feet. Since it's nearly impossible to turn this beast of an RV around without Wal-mart size parking lot, were were forced to go \\\"around the block\\\" for about 20-30 minutes and try it again. Unfortunately the country roads were extreme narrow and busy with 50ft ditch mere inches away. I was freaked out sitting in the passenger's seat during the entire trip. It as dark by the time we made it back around but we made sure not to miss the entrance the second time.\\n\\nThe campground was part of the Equestrian Center so we had to check-in at the arena. After the short walk we took our pick of the RV spots (there were only 5 or so other campers) and unloaded. The RV parks wasn't much to talk about, a big open lot with water and electricty but the bathrooms were close, clean and super heated!! Toasty warm.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/01/2014-11-24-18-46-39.jpg)\\n\\nIt was getting near 6pm and we could see the girls physically decreasing in size so we looked on Yelp for some local food. I made Cathy's night by finding a sushi place 2 miles away. We were pleasantly surprised that the sushi was cheap and amazingly delicious!\\n\\nThe next day was school and work. The last day for the girls before Thanksgiving break. Cathy and I tried to run the fatness off our bodies (#fail) and then spent most of the day working. We took off around 4pm to do \\\"fun and educational\\\" stuff with the girls.\\n\\nThe area we were staying in was just on the edge of the LSU campus. Apparently there isn't much to do in \\\"downtown\\\" Baton Rouge so we stayed near the campus with the cool little restaurants and bars. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/01/2014-11-25-15-30-17.jpg)\\n\\nOur first stop was down the road at the LSU campus to see [Mike the Tiger](http://www.mikethetiger.com/), the LSU mascot. Mike was tired so we only stayed for a minutes and then headed into the bookstore next door, proudly displaying our [UK colors](http://www.uky.edu/).\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/01/2014-11-25-16-17-04.jpg)\\n\\nOur next stop was educational, the [Bluebonnet Swamp Nature Center](http://brec.org/index.cfm/park/detail/19) just off the main road. We spent an hour or so walking through the swamp (they had a wooden pathway) and looking at snakes, turtles and birds in the education center. We asked the two girls working at the education center where a \\\"hip, cool\\\" place would be to take the girls. They said, \\\"whenvever anyone's parents come to town we always take them to [The Chimes](http://www.thechimes.com/)\\\". \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/01/2014-11-25-17-45-28.jpg)\\n\\nSo we headed down into the bowels of LSU and finally found parking for The Chimes! What an awesome place! 160+ beers and awsome food!! We had such a great time eating Alligator bites, boudin omelets and drinking craft beer.

After getting homework and laundry done that morning, we packed up and headed to NOLA, arriving around 3pm.  The Parc D'orleans RV park was an absolute dump. It was in a \\\"not so great\\\" part of town, the bathrooms were filthy and the location backed up to the largest railway yard I've ever seen. There were 8 tracks about 200 feet behind us with trains and whistles coming and going **all hours** of the night.

Our first stop, as always, was [Cafe Du Monde](http://www.cafedumonde.com/) for beignets. The place was busy as always but we finally found a table and ordered. The girls fell in love with beignets! We couldn't eat them often enough for them and eventually Hali counldn't stand the sight of them. Not Kira and Lexi. Kira stated a number of times throughout the week that she wanted to move to New Orleans so she could eat beignets all the time. \\n\\nI had intentionally ordered only 1-2 beignets per person so that they girls didn't fill up for dinner and they would want to come back for more (not a hard thing to do). We walked through the Farmer's Market on our way to Frenchmen's St. stopping at our favorite little toy store on the way. We promised the girls a toy while in NOLA and if we had been smart we would have purchased one for them at the start. That's all they talked about was getting a toy for 5 days!! We made it to Frenchmen's St (the Jazz district) and looked for somewhere we could have dinner and listen to a little jazz. Not many places allow kids (NOLA = Bars) but we finally found [The Three Muses](http://www.thethreemuses.com/) where there was a jazz piano player. We had just purchased a Louis Armstrong book in the little toy store for Hali and everyone thought she was awesome for reading it at dinner. We shared \\\"small plates\\\" and drank \\\"Mexican\\\" Coke with real sugar. The girls thought that was awesome.\\n\\nAfter dinner we walked 30 minutes or so back to the Jeep, past Cafe Du Monde, down Bourbon St. and up Dauphine. The next morning I looked at the map and realized that we'd parked about 5 minutes (3 blocks) from the Three Muses and walked all that way around in a huge circle for nothing!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-11-27-08-58-17.jpg)\\n\\nThursday was of course Thanksgiving. We stuck around the RV for the day and Cathy cooked delicious meals of turkey, ham, stuffing, mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes. Everyone was stuffed and miserable but of course we kept eating. Cathy was a little depressed and jealous when she saw on Facebook that the family was at home playing cards without her. We watched TV and played on computers for most of the day but I think everyone was ready to get out of the house.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-11-28-14-14-09.jpg)\\n\\n**Friday was \\\"Swampboat Day\\\"!** We'd made reservations the previous night with [Airboat Adventures](http://www.airboatadventures.com/) to ride the airboats about 30 minutes south of NOLA in the swamp. This was probably the non-food highlight of our trip. There were about 20 or so of us in the boat and the driver asked Hali if she wanted to sit up top with him. So, as Hali always does, she jumped at the chance and climbed into the seat next to him. We zipped around the water for 15 minutes or so when he spotted a small alligator and pulled over. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-11-28-15-41-51.jpg)\\n\\nApparently gators hibernate this time of year but this one was still up and about. He tried to grab him with his hands but unfortunately missed. As everyone turned around to look back in the water he pulled out at 20\\\" gator from under the seat and started passing it around. I made each one of the girls hold the gator while we took pictures and eventually they were pretty comfortable with it. It was pretty darn cute. Check out the videos.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\\"//player.vimeo.com/video/113333686\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"281\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n<iframe src=\\\"//player.vimeo.com/video/113333685\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"281\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nEveryone also had a chance to hold a tiny baby gator as well. Super fun and we got tons of great photos so check out the slideshow below. All three girls got to sit with the driver in the cold wind (it was in the low 60's) and never complained. He was super nice and a lot of fun. I would highly recommend the trip to anyone.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-11-28-15-36-24.jpg)\\n\\nAfter playing with the gators we headed back into NOLA for dinner. We were a little early for dinner and opted instead for more beignets. Cafe Du Monde was packed as usual so we headed down the street to Cafe Beignet instead. Not as good but the girls still ate all of them as fast as they could. Afterwards everyone was too stuffed for dinner so after an hour or so we decided to head back home instead of waiting for dinner. The real reason was that Cathy was cold.\\n\\nSaturday was culture day. We had plans to visit the African Museum in the morning and then a historical cemetery tour at 1pm. I called for direction to the museum mid-morning and found out that they were closed. Permanently. So to kill some time we headed into NOLA and went to one of our favorite BBQ places, Voodoo BBQ on Charles St. Lexi **LOVES** ribs so she was in heaven. The food was great! \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-11-29-15-52-38.jpg)\\n\\nWe walked around the French Quarter for awhile, killing time before our 2 hour cemetery walk. We spent a little time haggling with the tour company over the lost credit card transaction before settling into some Bloody Marys before we began the tour. The weather was gorgeous (72 and sunny) and the walk was fun and interesting. We looked at all of the cool graves, monuments and tombs in St. Louis Cemetery I and learned how they recycle the space for new family members. Yuck!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-11-29-15-55-59.jpg)\\n\\nWe finished up around \\\"snack 30\\\" (either 10:30am or 3:30pm depending on the time of day) and headed to one of our favorite restaurants, [Oceania](http://www.oceanagrill.com/), for snacks. Kira got fried fish, the other girls ordered gigantic pieces of cheesecake while I had a beer. In the end I was the only smart one as no one else was hungry by dinner time.  Since it was still early we decided to head back home (everyone but me was miserable) with aspiration of coming back for jazz at the Preservation Hall at 8pm. We never made it back into the city but we had good intensions.\\n\\nSunday was our last day and we saved it for a special occasion. The National WWII Museum is located in NOLA and since we'd be seeing Grandpa soon we decided to give the girls a little taste of his life while growing up and his time WWII. The girls spent most of the morning on their computers playing Smallworld while Cathy watched church. Around lunchtime we headed back to NOLA and ate lunch at [Muriel's Jackson Square](http://www.muriels.com/). A little pricy and fancy but they had a live jazz trio for brunch so Cathy was happy. The restaurant is supposedly haunted so we talked about the legend of the ghost that lives in the restaurant and how ghosts are \\\"mostly nice\\\". \\n\\nWith full bellies we stumbled across Jackson Square to find a carriage ride around the city. Lexi picked the horse with the pick glitter painted hooves. Naturally! It was a fun 30 minute ride through the city and once again Lexi fell asleep. She's batting 1000 for sleeping on tours now. Afterward we were off to the museum.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-11-30-16-16-30.jpg)\\n\\nWe spent a good 2-3 hours wandering around the museum studying the European and Pacific battles. I tried to relate everything to grandpa growing up and his time in the Navy during WWII. We even found displays, exhibits and short movies about the battles he was in. Hali lasted for a couple of hours, Kira for 30 minutes or so and Lexi just wanted to run through the museum and complete the scavenger hunt. Cathy and I had a great time and hopefully some things soaked in.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-11-30-18-32-18.jpg)\\n\\nIt was getting to be dinner time and everyone was famished so we headed back to the French Quarter for our \\\"last supper\\\"! We didn't have too much time to find something \\\"kid friendly\\\" on Bourbon St and wandered in to Pat O'Brien's Courtyard. We ate lightly (except for Kira) and made our way back home.

There were 8 tracks about 200 feet behind us with trains and whistles coming and going <strong>all hours</strong> of the night.

Since Cathy was born and raised and I went to college there, we spent a lot of time just catching up with friends and relatives, eating out, going to Keeneland and visiting places that we frequented when we were younger and thinner. We stayed in Cathy's cousin's (Joe) driveway, so we didn't have to shellout any more hard-earned cash for RV fees. Our only expense was taking him out to dinner a number of times. Not a bad deal. \\n\\nWe pulled into Lexington Thursday afternoon towing our badly injured Jeep. Since we couldn't get it to run we dropped it off at Cathy's Dad's old repair shop with the guy he trusted. His goal was to fix the power problem, get the heater working and, hopefully, fix the ticking noise we'd had since NYC. We thought it would only take a couple of day and we'd rent a car to get us around town. Unfortunately it was Keeneland and Homecoming weekend so we were $h!t out of luck. Fortunately Joe had an extra Suburban that he loaned us.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-10-25-15-17-59.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday was the big day we'd been planning for months. We had rushed down to KY so we could catch the last day of the ponies running at [Keeneland](http://www.keeneland.com/). As Kentuckians, we were required by law to attend at least once every two years. We missed the first few races but stayed till the end wagering $2 at a time on horses for each of us. Kira won on her very first race and Lexi and I won shortly thereafter. Mom and Hali finally won in the last couple of races. \\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-10-25-17-10-28.jpg)\\n\\nI think after food, beverages and wagers we were only down $20 or so for the day. I'd call that a win. We met up with one of Cathy's cousins and his wife and hung out with them for awhile before heading out. The weather was absolutely fabulous and the girls had a blast. We watched the horseys, over-ate on nachos and beer and had some fun betting and rooting on our horses. Plus, the girls got some culture Kentucky-sytle.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-10-26-19-52-10.jpg)\\n\\nOn Monday Cathy flew out to see Brittany in OK for a couple of days so I had to be both the good cop and bad cop for awhile. Things went well until I tried to wash the RV. Apparently the \\\"Hey y'all, watch this!\\\" mentality came out in me and I decided to climb on to the wet, soapy hood of the RV. It only took 10 seconds or so until I slipped and landed square on my face (literally) on the driveway. In retrospect I should have gone to the hospital as I most likely had a concussion. I had a headache most of the day (naturally) and was nauseous. Cathy made me take her out to dinner that night since we had a babysitter but, looking back, I'm not sure that was such a good idea. Fortunately I was back to my normal, stupid self the next day but I think I've learned my lesson.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-10-26-17-20-22.jpg)\\n\\nWhile mom was away we mainly stayed in the RV (the dog staying in Joe's house was wreaking havoc on the girls' respiratory system) and did school work. We did however get a chance to setup Hali's new [Kano](http://www.kano.me/) computer and get her running. She was hacking away at Minecraft in no time. I'll make her a programmer in no time!! She really loves it!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/2014-10-31-19-06-31.jpg)\\n\\nCathy got home Friday and we decided to spend one more night in Lexington. It was Halloween and the girls were clamouring about trick-or-treating. It was super cold and rainly that night so we schlepped them down to the mall and walked around with the rest of humanity trying to stay ouf of the weather. It was really a terrible excuse for trick-or-treating and I'm still ashamed of myself.\\n\\nWe actually stayed in Lexington a few days longer that we anticipated. We had taken the Jeep into the shop and found out that the ticking was a bad transfer case. It took awhile to get a used one shipped in and that's what caused the delay. We decided that we couldn't wait any longer for the Jeep so we decided to rent a car and head to Mammoth Cave.

I pictured an island like Siesta Key, FL and it turned out to be more like Bradenton, FL. Maybe it was the fact that most of the attractions were closed due to the off season or the refineries and ports dotting the horizon, but it seemed more of an industrial town than a tourist attraction. That being said, we did have a good time and have some great memories of Galveston.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/01/2014-12-05-12-03-26.jpg)\\n\\nThe 3.5 hour drive form Lake Charles, LA to Galveston was unremarkable with the exception of our arrival. As we crossed over onto the island we ran into a wall of fog which we found out was fairly typical for that time of the year. It was spooky-foggy a couple of mornings during our stay but it burned off in the late mornings. The RV park was located on the bay-side so we were 30 feet or so from water. It was a pretty view but quite windy most of the time.\\n\\nWe immediately setup camp and headed downtown to see the things that were there to see. The twilight drive made the town look a little dreary and all of the ports and grain towers didn't help either. However, it was actually really nice.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/01/2014-12-05-14-14-09.jpg)\\n\\nDowntown (Strand St.) is about 5-10 blocks long interspersed with t-shirt shops and cool little stores. We happened across [Brews Brothers](https://www.facebook.com/BrewsBrothersGalveston) (actually I found it on Yelp!) which only sold craft beers and some bar food. Kids were welcome so we indulged in a bunch of craft beer and some really good burgers and BBQ.

I'm glad I finally gave in (this time!) as we had a great time spelunking!\\n\\nOn our final morning in Lexington, we spent some more time with Joe over coffee and breakfast before taking off. The Jeep was still in the shop so we decided to rent a car and head to Mammoth Cave anyway. We weren't sure exactly when the Jeep would be done but I'd simply drive the couple of hours back to Lexington to pick it up when it was ready. \\n\\nWe pulled into the Jellystone park around noon and setup camp. We headed over to the snack bar for a quick bite before joining the 1,000 other kids at the park on the jumping pillow. We tried to stay in the sun as much as possible as Cathy was miserable. My wife does not like cold weather.\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/15668995396_f915068a57_h.jpg)\\n\\nAt 6pm we started trick-or-treating at the park. Apparently Halloween is a **huge** deal at Jellystone as people pulled out all the stops. Kira was a little freaked out with some of the decorations and haunted houses at the park, but after awhile she started to have a blast. It was super cold so we only stayed out for an hour or so. The girls were cold in their costumes plus, it seemed like everyone in the park had started fires and it was starting to affect the girls' breathing. Afterwards we headed to Wal-Mart to buy heavy jackets, hats, mittens and 3 space heaters. It was well below freezing so I removed the water hose so our lines wouldn't freeze. \\n\\nEveryone got up **super early** on Sunday. Daylight saving took effect plus we'd crossed into Central Timezone the day before so everyone's biological clock was off by a couple of ours. We had breakfast, played on the computers and then headed over to [Mammoth Cave](http://www.nps.gov/maca/index.htm) for our first cave tour. Unfortunately the one we wanted was sold out so we killed time in the gift shop and having lunch until the \\\"Historic\\\" tour started. Everyone has a blast going through the cave, especially \\\"fat man's misery\\\". Kira was a little hesitant during some parts of the caves but she did great. The other two had a blast!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/15522633509_bc3cf5ea03_k.jpg)\\n\\nAfter the tour we decided to head to Bowling Green for Corvette Museum and dinner. We're not huge Corvette fans but it was actually really cool! The girls' favorite part was the [sinkhole that had swallowed 8 cars](http://www.wdrb.com/story/24702432/sinkhole-damages-six-cars-at-corvette-museum). Afterwards we found a cool little beer/sports bar where we watched some football and ate some wings. They even had self-service craft beer!! I know... OMG!\\n\\nMonday was a typical day with school and work. Nothing special. The girls were a little grumpy fighting with one another. However, we found a descent Mexican restaurant down the road for dinner so everyone was happy then. The highlight of the night was Cathy cutting her hair after a few margaritas!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2014/12/15523312807_eb14ecc45d_k-2.jpg)\\n\\nTuesday was a good day at school. Lexi actually finished all of her 2nd grade work so she and Cathy were going back and redoing some of the stuff she had a difficult time with. Pretty impressive!

We had no idea how were were going to get everything (or anything) back to Mammoth Cave. Lucky Joe came to the rescue. We went out and bought some tie-downs and rigged everyting on the back of the Jeep between the spare tire and bike rake. It was extremely \\\"Beverly Hillbillies\\\" but it got the job done.\\n\\nThursday we had a 10:30am appointment at Camping World to have some work done on the RV so we pulled out early and headed to Bowling Green. We actually spent most of the day doing work and school at the waiting room at Camping World.

I'm pretty sure she had a\nbeer or two at dinner.\n\n\n\nI, on the other hand, had landed back in Florida with Hali and rented a yellow\nCamaro convertable (Hali's idea) for our stay there. We arrived late to our\nfriends Mike and Gena's house and hit the sack as soon as he set foot in the\ndoor. It was a long trip.\n\nThe next was my birthday and it was filled with errands and appointments for\nboth Hali and me. I went to the Podiatrist and he diagnosed me with Plantar\nfasciitis and gave me a couple of cortisone shots in my heels before sending me\non my way with some treatment instructions. I attempted to get my teeth cleaned\n(no available openings!) and my license renewed. Unfortunately I didn't have the\ncorrect paperwork so I'd have to get into our storage POD and try again the next\nday. Gena took Hali to a couple of appointments at the CF clinic while I\nfinished out some work at Starbucks.\n\n\n\nSince it was my birthday, Cathy had arranged for the family to meet me at\nBonefish in Bradenton for dinner. I spent my birthday without my wife (sniff...\nsniff) but did get to see Scott, Sara, Bonnie, Denise, Joey and Cecil. It was a\nfun time catching up and there were a lot of good-bye hugs.\n\n\n\nCathy spent most of her day with the girls doing school work and some laundry.\nThey explored the RV park including the pool and the waterfront and she deemed\nit not as horrible as they thought the previous night. She then capped it off at\na nearby Mexican restaurant with a ferris wheel!!\n\nThe next day I borrowed Scott's truck and stopped by Bonnie's house to pick up\nour patio furniture and take it the storage POD (Bonnie was selling her house).\nI dropped off the furniture and picked up all of our important papers\n(passports, birth certificates, etc) from storage. I headed back to get my\nlicense but my birth certificate was issued by the hospital and not the state\nand once again I was denied. They issued me a 60 day temporary permit and I'd\nhave to come back sometime in February and try again. #massivefail So I picked\nup Hali and we headed to TPA for our flight back to Corpus Christi.\n\n\n\nFriday was our last day in Corpus Christi and after work and school Cathy took\nus into what can best be described as \"downtown\". We found a little place called\nthe Executive Surf Club [http://www.executivesurfclub.com] for dinner. It was\nactually pretty cool with a number of craft beers and tables made from surf\nboards.\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we headed back home and I opened my birthday cards and presents\nfrom the girls. It was actually a lot of fun!\n\nThe next morning and we did some laundry and took showers before packing up and\nheading to Grandma and Grandpa's house in McAllen. Tyler had arrived the\nprevious day and everyone was anxious to arrive and officially start the\nHolidays.\n\n \n\nDates: December 16th - December 20th\nRV Park: Sea Breeze RV Park [http://www.seabreezerv.com/], Corpus Christi, TX","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/02/2014-12-19-20-07-27.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-01-18T19:24:55.000Z","updated_at":"2015-02-10T13:39:30.000Z","published_at":"2015-02-10T13:39:30.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f1c","uuid":"1213d97a-135f-4514-8101-3319e5a136a5","title":"Christmas in Mission, TX","slug":"mission-tx","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"The 3+ weeks we spent in Mission for Christmas with Grandma & Great-Grandpa flew by too fast.

We had to make a quick stop a the Camping World along the way as the electrical tow cable broke and we had no running or brake lights on the Jeep. Luckily the cops never spotted us! We pulled into the campground around 6pm and finally found our spot in the dark despite having two different site numbers. After partially setting up in the cold, I hopped on Yelp and found [Trudy's](http://www.trudys.com/trudys-south.php) about a mile down the road.

No one really wanted to go but it turned out to be the second best meal we've had on our trip so far. [Gourdough's Public House](http://gourdoughs.com/) is a funky little restaurant bar with a ton of craft beers and **all of their food is served on donuts**. Yes! Donuts.  I had chicken fried steak, on top of a potato pancake on top of a donut covered in gravy with cranberries. Cathy had bacon-wrapped meatloaf, on a potato pancake on a donut with candied jalapenos. It was about 30 minutes this side of heaven!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/01/2015-01-15-20-00-24.jpg)\\n\\nThe weather broke on Thursday and we finally saw the sun. The city looked a little less dreary and depressing so we decided to head downtown to 6th St. for the first time. Cathy's friend from high school, Wynn, was playing at the [Chuggin' Monkey](http://www.thechugginmonkey.com/1.0/homepage/) from 5-8pm (a kid friendly time) so we decided to say \\\"hi\\\" and listen for awhile! The bartender kicked us out promptly at 8pm so we headed across the street for some really good tex-mex tacos! BTW, 6th St. isn't that impressive when you have kids. However, if we were still in our 20's-30's, Cathy & I  would love Austin!\\n\\n![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/01/2015-01-16-17-45-20.jpg)\\n\\nWe were supposed to leave Austin on Friday to but decided to extend our stay for 2 days to \\\"give Austin a chance\\\".

However, since we were leaving the next day we decided this wasn't the time. We headed down to the River Walk for one last dinner and to say good-bye to the city we'd fell in love with before heading home and to bed. \\n\\nThe next morning we packed up and got ready to take me and Hali to the airport. Hali needed to head back to Sarasota for some treatments and I needed to renew my driver's license which I could only do in person. We waited awhile before actually taking off for the airport as we were waiting on Cathy's cowboy boot to arrive in the mail. They were supposed to be delivered days before but tracking number said they were still enroute. We eventually decided to take off and head to the airport and then have Cathy return to wait for her boots. Fortunately the UPS truck arrived at exactly the same time that we were pulling out of the RV park so I jumped out and fetched her boots.\\n\\nWe stopped across the street to the super-huge car wash to spray down the RV before Cathy dropped us off at the airport and headed to Corpus Christi with the two little girls.

The we headed back home, puttered\naround the house for awhile and finally put the girls to bed before hopping into\nthe hot tub to relax for awhile.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday we decided to journey into \"the wild\"! We drove an hour or so to \nNatural Bridge Wildlife Ranch [https://wildliferanchtexas.com], a huge ranch\nwith a petting barnyard, plus driving & walking encounters with giraffes, zebras\n& more. In a nutshell, you drive through the ranch and animals come up to your\ncar and eat from your hands out of the windows. What a blast!! There are a ton\nof great pictures and videos below but the best are of the zebra\n[http://vimeo.com/119149456] and ostrich [http://vimeo.com/119149459] that tried\nto eat Cathy's face. So much fun!!!!\n\nAfterwards we drove back to San Antonio and stopped at one of our favorite\nspots, the Brick House Tavern + Tap [http://brickhousetavernandtap.com], which\nviolated our \"never eat at the same place twice\". However, since the first time\nwas in Galveston we decided it was a loophole we could live with. Then back home\nfor a quiet night before putting the girls to bed and taking a long walk around\nthe RV park.\n\n\n\nMonday was our last day in San Antonio and was spent it doing school and\nhomework. For some reason we had an itch to look at new RVs so when the day was\ndone we headed over to the ExploreUSA RV Supercenter and realized that we needed\nto buy a 5th wheel RV. However, since we were leaving the next day we decided\nthis wasn't the time. We headed down to the River Walk for one last dinner and\nto say good-bye to the city we'd fell in love with before heading home and to\nbed.\n\nThe next morning we packed up and got ready to take me and Hali to the airport.\nHali needed to head back to Sarasota for some treatments and I needed to renew\nmy driver's license which I could only do in person. We waited awhile before\nactually taking off for the airport as we were waiting on Cathy's cowboy boot to\narrive in the mail. They were supposed to be delivered days before but tracking\nnumber said they were still enroute. We eventually decided to take off and head\nto the airport and then have Cathy return to wait for her boots. Fortunately the\nUPS truck arrived at exactly the same time that we were pulling out of the RV\npark so I jumped out and fetched her boots.\n\nWe stopped across the street to the super-huge car wash to spray down the RV\nbefore Cathy dropped us off at the airport and headed to Corpus Christi with the\ntwo little girls. She'd have to pull into the new campground at night all by\nherself. I knew she could handle it.\n\n \n\nDates: December 9th - December 16th\nRV Park: Braunig Lake RV Resort [http://www.brauniglakervresort.com/], San\nAntonio, TX","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2015/02/2014-12-13-17-00-30.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-02-03T23:36:49.000Z","updated_at":"2015-02-09T18:06:15.000Z","published_at":"2015-02-09T18:06:15.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f20","uuid":"27ff93aa-7187-4e93-b9c0-359a6ede9a94","title":"YEEHAW!!!

We didn't know what to expect from our next stop, Las Cruces, but we were glad to be on our way. Shortly after lunch on Thursday we packed up and got started on our 3 hour trip west. Once our little RV made it up through the mountain pass (it had a hard time with the 7500 ft ascent) it was smooth sailing down the other side. From then on it was mostly a desert drive with not much to see or do. \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/16516910621_5742acbea7_c.jpg)\\n\\nAbout an hour or so from Las Cruces we spotted the sign for White Sands National Monument and we quickly discussed stopping as we'd heard it was pretty cool. After a minute or two conversation about how we could possibly stop back and \\\"do we really want to do this or push on to Las Cruces\\\", we decided to pull over and take a look. After a quick chat with the cashier we were immediate glad that we did. She gave us the scoop that we could drive our RV out to the sand dunes and go sledding for a couple of hours until sunset. So we quickly bought a couple of saucer sleds and some snacks and hopped back into the RV and headed to the dunes.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7287/16517595972_13ed7032bf_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe parked the RV next to the dunes and frolicked around the hills for a couple of hours before they closed the park.

The Main St. Bistro was closed for a private party that day and so we went in search of food somewhere else. The downtown two blocks of Las Cruces is very cute but definitely needs more businesses since nothing was open except for a tiny little hamburger joint that was “just getting ready to close\\\". Everyone was grumpy while eating their burgers outside so we decided to skip the nearby museum (it was closing in an hour anyway) and head back home to rest up for the concert.\\n\\nSince the concert would run late we headed back to the Main St. Bistro early for a late dinner but they only had a limited menu since it was Valentine's Day. I wanted to like this place but they weren't making it easy. The girls weren't too thrilled with the menu but everyone survived. We'd never heard of Josh Grinder before (apparently he is big in Texas!) but he put on a great show.

We stopped by Game Stop as the girls' gift card were burning holes in their pockets before heading to the [New Mexico Farm & Ranch Heritage Museum](http://www.nmfarmandranchmuseum.org/) for some *learnin'*. Cathy and I thought it was interesting but it was a little boring for the girls except for the sheep, cows, goats and playground. I did buy a [sweet knife made by the blacksmith from a railroad spike](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffdonthemic/16543091252/in/set-72157651135268620). \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7378/16356957778_73d1d99706_c.jpg)\\n\\nThen it was back the White Sands for a couple of hours of sledding.

We may be doing this for awhile.\n\nWe bought our little 31' Class C RV about a year ago and we've definitely\noutgrown it. The main issue is that Cathy and I cannot sit in the living room\nafter the kids go to bed as it disturbs Hali. Her bedroom is located over the\ncab, which is essentially in the living room. Therefore, around 8pm or so we are\nrelegated to our bedrooms or outside.\n\nWhen we were in Texas for Christmas we decided that we wanted to switch things\nup and get a Fifth Wheel RV. We found one we really liked with the master\nbedroom in the front and a room with 4 bunks in the back separated by the living\narea. It was perfect. We found a truck to pull it with and had a buyer for our\nJeep. Unfortunately we couldn't get a good trade-in value for our RV so after a\ncouple of weeks the deal fell through.\n\nAs we've made our way west I've emailed dealers looking for specific RVs and\nhaven't found anything we've really liked. We were close a couple of times but\nit never really felt right.\n\n\n\nWe sold our last rental house while in Las Vegas last week so I blasted out a\nbunch of emails to dealers in San Diego and one came through. The same dealer we\nbought our RV from has their HQ in San Diego and they had one that looked very\npromising according to the Youtube video. We headed over last Friday after work\nand fell in love with it. It has essentially everything we need including an\nactual tub in the bathroom and reclining sofa chairs in the living room! Two of\nthe things that Cathy and I really wanted. We wrapped up the deal in a couple of\nhours and were the proud owners of a 36' Heartland Gateway Fifth Wheel!!\n\nHere's a video of the RV if you are interested.

Downtown is a little touristy but with the city nestled in the red mountains it's irresistible. We stayed there mainly due to it's close close proximity to Flagstaff (skiing & the Grand Canyon are on the agenda) but Cathy quickly fell in love with it! The weather was great during our entire stay and we had a blast! For a number of reasons (see below), we will definitely be back. It's gorgeous!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8654/16039904724_0bfa41fed8_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe pulled into the RV park (southwest of Sedona) early evening and got setup. The RV park was in this cool little valley but things were just \\\"strange\\\". For instance, it cost $1.50 for each package delivered while staying and the washing machines only took tokens with quarters but there was no change machine nearby. Anywhere. Anyway.. after everything was unhooked and extended, we ventured into Sedona, drove around town to get the lay of the land and had a bite to eat at the Cowboy Cafe. Dinner was good and consisted of prickly pear margarita and fried cactus for appetizers! You wouldn't think, but fried cactus is actually pretty yummy. We spent the rest of the night getting ready for a big weekend of skiing!! It was going to be an early morning.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8569/16617446882_1c044d47a3_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe took off at 6am Saturday morning for the 1.5 hour drive north to Arizona Snowbowl in Flagstaff. We put all of the girls in ski school for the weekend and Cathy and I skied mostly the bunny slopes. Everyone was exhausted. \\n\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8575/16431072230_be32a71bdc_z.jpg)\\n\\nWe stayed the night at the small lodge at the base of the mountain and did everything all over again on Sunday. I actually dropped the girls off early at ski school and came back to get Cathy so she could sleep in. The girls had a good time the entire weekend but Kira was not a fan of the cold weather. Whenever she'd see us skiing past, Kira would just stare holes in us through her goggles to come an get here. There are some great pictures and videos below to look at.\\n\\nMost of the week was typical school and work with some cool stuff in the evenings. On Monday we ran to Scottsdale for a Salesforce Developer User Group meeting. Since I was in town they arranged a quick, impromptu meeting at a local brewery. About 10 people showed up and they even bought the family dinner. It actually turned out to be a great time.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8651/16455732177_5c75bd9384_b.jpg)\\n\\nTuesday we drove around the scenic routes outside of town looking at the cool mountains, the Chapel of the Holy Cross and taking funny photos. The big thing in Sedona is to take a Jeep ride through the desert. Well.... since we have a Jeep I decided to take the same trail myself.  After about 50 yards of the girls screaming, \\\"... ah ...it's too bumpy...\\\" I decided to turn around and head back to town for dinner.  We found the Oak Creek Brewery and had a great dinner... complete with a beer sampler flight!!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8683/16450851817_115a56daf5_c.jpg)\\n\\nWednesday we had a date with a helicopter after work. A couple of days earlier we'd found a place where if you sit for a timeshare marketing pitch you'd get half price tickets on a helicopter tour around the mountains! This was a no-brainer since we certainly weren't going to buy a timeshare (Cathy and I are great at saying \\\"no\\\" in these types of circumstances) and we love saving money!! The helicopter trip was an absolute blast. Hali got to sit up front with the pilot and the other girls were in the back with us wearing headsets. They had so much fun talking to one another throughout the flight. We had a great time and the mountain scenery can't be beat!\\n\\nThere were two big events on Thursday. First, we FedEx'd the closing documents for our last rental house. We were finally free of tenants!!! Then we attended the mandatory timeshare sales pitch. We were essentially the only ones there and we had a pretty good time with the sales ladies talking about our trip, foster kids, bio kids, etc. However, we were damned and determined that we weren't going to buy a timeshare and our body language spoke loudly.\\t\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8571/16656776301_819108719f_c.jpg)\\n\\nWell, to make a long story short, we are now the proud owners of a timeshare in Sedona! Apparently timeshares have changed a lot since we bought our first one and now they are all based upon points which you can spend anywhere you'd like. We bought the smallest package available which came with 2 free weeks anywhere plus **2 free weeks per month** at the RV spots in our timeshare in Sedona. We'll definitely be back for some free stays next summer.\\n\\nGlobal warming was having an impact and things were getting cold. We had been watching the weather for the past few days and it was damn cold in the Grand Canyon. So we'd decided to push our trip back by a couple of days and go skiing Saturday and then do the Grand Canyon on Sunday for just one day. We had plans to come back to the Grand Canyon next summer as Lexi was too small to do the donkey ride down into the canyon.

It wasn't much of an RV park but it was close to Snowbowl and did have a super fun restaurant on the property.  The [Black Bart's Steakhouse, Saloon, & Musical Revue](http://www.blackbartssteakhouse.com/) is a 35 year old steakhouse where the wait staff (music students from the local college) perform on stage in a Musical Revue, including songs from Broadway, Disney, 60s and 70s, and much more! It was so unexpected and so much fun!  Check out [the video](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffdonthemic/17097412410/). After dinner we walked back across the parking lot and worried about how cold it was becoming as the show was beginning to fall again. We quickly pulled the water hoses in and tried to keep the RV as warm as possible as we hit the sack.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8608/16489940708_1787372969_c.jpg)\\n\\nIt was in the high teens with light flurries when we woke up in the morning. We were worried what might be frozen on our RV but there was no way to tell at that point. Besides, we had skiing to do!! The kids had a hearty breakfast of donuts and bacon before we loaded everyone up and headed back to the mountain for a day of skiing. Again, we put the girls into ski school and Cathy and I took snowboarding lessons. I'd always wanted to learn but felt I needed to help Cathy and the kids out while skiing and I just felt more comfortable on skis. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8595/16057430843_0714319e00_c.jpg)\\n\\nAt the end of our lessons it was lunch time and Kira wasn't feeling well. Cathy called it quits for the day and sat with her in the lodge for the rest of the day while the rest of us ran the slopes. I spent the next couple of hours snowboarding by myself and getting pretty good if I do say so. Towards the end of the day I found Hali and we spent the last hour or so together. She was getting pretty good as well. We passed Lexi a couple of time in her class and she was coming along quite nicely. Everyone had a blast but was tired.  When skiing was done for the day we quickly turned it our equipment and rushed down the mountain to our RV. We stripped off our ski clothes, packed up the RV and took off a few minutes west to Williams, AZ to the [Grand Canyon Railway Hotel](http://www.thetrain.com/lodging/the-grand-canyon-railway-hotel/).\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8565/16505024419_5473e69832_c.jpg)\\n\\nCathy had booked us on a 4 hour round trip train ride to see the Grand Canyon. When we arrived at the hotel is was starting to snow again so I quickly picked up our train tickets and checked us into our room. We decided to eat at the pub in the restaurant and then play a rousing game of \\\"drown dad\\\" in the pool. A lovely evening.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8666/16070937343_f4376f0a14_c.jpg)\\n\\nThe next morning we woke up early to 6-8 inches of snow. Our RV was buried and as cold as ice. Apparently we'd left one of the overhead lights on which drained the battery so much that the propane heater didn't kick on. Luckily the engine started right back up and within a few minutes the propane heater started thawing things out.  Hopefully nothing was frozen as we'd drained everything the night before.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8616/16691169445_aa22ac43c3_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe had the overpriced buffet breakfast next door and hopped on the train at 9:30am. It was a 2 hour ride to the Grand Canyon and it continued to snow. And snow. They do a great job of keeping everyone entertained during the trip with a steward for each car and some singing cowboys roaming from car to car. It continued to snow for the entire trip.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8646/16504891139_334717f346_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe arrived at the Grand Canyon and the snow was really coming down. You couldn't see more then maybe 100 yards ahead of you. It was total white-out. You couldn't see the Grand Canyou at all. We had to take an employee's word that there was a giant hole in front of us. So we essentially just walked around the edge of the Grand Canyon feeling sorry for ourselves and throwing snowballs at each other. A great way to blow $500!\\n\\nAfter lunch in the restaurant and blowing more money in the gift shops, everyone boarded the train and headed back to the hotel. The weather reports kept coming in that this was the worst winter storm they'd had all year and it was going to come down for days. We'd probably received 12 inches during the daytime and they were expecting 12-18 inches tomorrow. It was forecast to snow till Wednesday. However, the highways were clear! The weren't expecting more snow till later that night. We weren't sure if we should try and leave immediately for Las Vegas or wait the storm out for 2-3 days in the expensive hotel. \\n\\nWe consulted the weather channel again and a couple of employees at the hotel and found out that once you make it about 10 miles west over the mountain pass it got considerable warmer. So we made bold (foolish?) decision to head out immediately. The roads were clear but but it was a little gusty and we didn't know if/when we'd hit a patch of black ice. It was some white-knuckle driving for 15-20 minutes until we finally started down the pass and we started to see less snow on the ground. We all took a deep breath.\\n\\nFrom then on the drive to Las Vegas was uneventful and we arrived RV park around 9pm or so. We had a nice little end spot in this really cool park and we hit the sack. Exhausted physically and mentally.\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157652142079666%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157652142079666%2F&set_id=72157652142079666&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157652142079666%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157652142079666%2F&set_id=72157652142079666&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: February 27th - March 1st  \\nRV Park: Black Bart's RV Park and Grand Canyon Railroad Hotel\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Our trip to Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon was crazy!

Our plan was to ski\nSnowbowl Arizona on Saturday and then visit the Grand Canyon Sunday before\nheading to Las Vegas. It turned out to be a fun, expensive and stressful\nweekend.\n\n\n\nWe left our spot near Sedona late Friday afternoon and drove north to Flagstaff\nto stay at Black Bart's RV Park. It wasn't much of an RV park but it was close\nto Snowbowl and did have a super fun restaurant on the property. The Black\nBart's Steakhouse, Saloon, & Musical Revue\n[http://www.blackbartssteakhouse.com/] is a 35 year old steakhouse where the\nwait staff (music students from the local college) perform on stage in a Musical\nRevue, including songs from Broadway, Disney, 60s and 70s, and much more! It was\nso unexpected and so much fun! Check out the video\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffdonthemic/17097412410/]. After dinner we\nwalked back across the parking lot and worried about how cold it was becoming as\nthe show was beginning to fall again. We quickly pulled the water hoses in and\ntried to keep the RV as warm as possible as we hit the sack.\n\n\n\nIt was in the high teens with light flurries when we woke up in the morning. We\nwere worried what might be frozen on our RV but there was no way to tell at that\npoint. Besides, we had skiing to do!! The kids had a hearty breakfast of donuts\nand bacon before we loaded everyone up and headed back to the mountain for a day\nof skiing. Again, we put the girls into ski school and Cathy and I took\nsnowboarding lessons. I'd always wanted to learn but felt I needed to help Cathy\nand the kids out while skiing and I just felt more comfortable on skis.\n\n\n\nAt the end of our lessons it was lunch time and Kira wasn't feeling well. Cathy\ncalled it quits for the day and sat with her in the lodge for the rest of the\nday while the rest of us ran the slopes. I spent the next couple of hours\nsnowboarding by myself and getting pretty good if I do say so. Towards the end\nof the day I found Hali and we spent the last hour or so together. She was\ngetting pretty good as well. We passed Lexi a couple of time in her class and\nshe was coming along quite nicely. Everyone had a blast but was tired. When\nskiing was done for the day we quickly turned it our equipment and rushed down\nthe mountain to our RV. We stripped off our ski clothes, packed up the RV and\ntook off a few minutes west to Williams, AZ to the Grand Canyon Railway Hotel\n[http://www.thetrain.com/lodging/the-grand-canyon-railway-hotel/].\n\n\n\nCathy had booked us on a 4 hour round trip train ride to see the Grand Canyon.\nWhen we arrived at the hotel is was starting to snow again so I quickly picked\nup our train tickets and checked us into our room. We decided to eat at the pub\nin the restaurant and then play a rousing game of \"drown dad\" in the pool. A\nlovely evening.\n\n\n\nThe next morning we woke up early to 6-8 inches of snow. Our RV was buried and\nas cold as ice. Apparently we'd left one of the overhead lights on which drained\nthe battery so much that the propane heater didn't kick on. Luckily the engine\nstarted right back up and within a few minutes the propane heater started\nthawing things out. Hopefully nothing was frozen as we'd drained everything the\nnight before.\n\n\n\nWe had the overpriced buffet breakfast next door and hopped on the train at\n9:30am. It was a 2 hour ride to the Grand Canyon and it continued to snow. And\nsnow. They do a great job of keeping everyone entertained during the trip with a\nsteward for each car and some singing cowboys roaming from car to car. It\ncontinued to snow for the entire trip.\n\n\n\nWe arrived at the Grand Canyon and the snow was really coming down. You couldn't\nsee more then maybe 100 yards ahead of you. It was total white-out. You couldn't\nsee the Grand Canyou at all. We had to take an employee's word that there was a\ngiant hole in front of us. So we essentially just walked around the edge of the\nGrand Canyon feeling sorry for ourselves and throwing snowballs at each other. A\ngreat way to blow $500!\n\nAfter lunch in the restaurant and blowing more money in the gift shops, everyone\nboarded the train and headed back to the hotel. The weather reports kept coming\nin that this was the worst winter storm they'd had all year and it was going to\ncome down for days. We'd probably received 12 inches during the daytime and they\nwere expecting 12-18 inches tomorrow. It was forecast to snow till Wednesday.\nHowever, the highways were clear! The weren't expecting more snow till later\nthat night. We weren't sure if we should try and leave immediately for Las Vegas\nor wait the storm out for 2-3 days in the expensive hotel.\n\nWe consulted the weather channel again and a couple of employees at the hotel\nand found out that once you make it about 10 miles west over the mountain pass\nit got considerable warmer. So we made bold (foolish?) decision to head out\nimmediately. The roads were clear but but it was a little gusty and we didn't\nknow if/when we'd hit a patch of black ice. It was some white-knuckle driving\nfor 15-20 minutes until we finally started down the pass and we started to see\nless snow on the ground. We all took a deep breath.\n\nFrom then on the drive to Las Vegas was uneventful and we arrived RV park around\n9pm or so. We had a nice little end spot in this really cool park and we hit the\nsack. Exhausted physically and mentally.\n\n \n\nDates: February 27th - March 1st\nRV Park: Black Bart's RV Park and Grand Canyon Railroad Hotel","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8701/17283608512_e2e8ab1b59_c.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-04-27T03:28:25.000Z","updated_at":"2015-05-27T20:02:52.000Z","published_at":"2015-04-29T11:38:02.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f28","uuid":"da6240d4-f2ee-404d-b9e1-3aa311538896","title":"Viva Las Vegas!!","slug":"las-vegas-nv","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"We had a blast in Vegas!

Afterwards we wandered around Luxor taking pictures with the\nEgyptian \"artifacts\" and generally having a good time. Cathy and I thought we'd\nlike to stay there sometime sans kids. Pretty cool place.\n\n\n\nWe headed out for the night and picked up Hali's prescription from Walgreens and\nrealized that the night was still young. So we turned the jeep around and headed\nback down the strip to the Mirage. Everything we read said the Volcano show\n[http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/mirage-volcano/] was amazing and\nthey weren't wrong. Really cool show and the kids had a good time. We'd\ndefinitely do that again. Then we went back home, put the kids to bed and hit\nthe sack. Unfortunately Hali had a coughing fit so no one got to sleep till well\nafter midnight.\n\nThursday was the usual \"pack up\" day. The girls had showers and Cathy did a load\nof laundry while I worked. Around noon-ish we packed up and headed out on the\nlong drive to San Diego!\n\n \n\nDates: March 1st - March 5th\nRV Park: Oasis Las Vegas RV Resort [http://www.oasislasvegasrvresort.com/], Las\nVegas, NV","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8608/16539756668_4a2babf6e4_c.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-05-01T02:10:20.000Z","updated_at":"2015-05-01T03:12:57.000Z","published_at":"2015-05-01T03:12:57.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f29","uuid":"38e4bbeb-d838-4280-95d1-6d5408303734","title":"Our \"New Home\" from San Diego","slug":"san-diego-ca","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"We left Las Vegas for San Diego without knowing how much our stay there would change our lives.

The weather was great, there was a lot to do and the traffic wasn't as bad as I expected. The traffic nightmare was much worse in Austin, TX! \\n\\nThe main reason for our stop was a mandatory visit to Disneyland. Since we've been Disneyworld pass holders for years, the girls have been looking forward to seeing how the park was in California. Kira had been researching the park on Youtube and already knew which rides were there and which ones she wanted to do. We also had a chance to catch up with our Brother-in-Law, Heinz, who had recently moved to the area.\\n\\nIt was dark and late when we pulled into our RV spot Wednesday night and we were tired from the 5 hour drive from Vegas. This was our first stop with our new 41' fifthwheel and the RV park was smaller than we'd hoped. It was a little tricky pulling into our spot on the end but I got it somewhat straight and we called it a night. We'd unhook in the morning. \\n\\nThursday was work and school as usual with one significant event. We dropped the RV on our new truck. Since this fifthwheel RV thing was new to us, we didn't know that it's advisable to have the truck pretty much pointing straight to hook up and unhook. The previous night I'd left it at a good 30 degree angle cause.. hell I didn't know any better! We had a hard time getting the RV unhooked due to the angle and after trying to slightly move it, unhook it, hook it back up to move it, whatever we could do to get it off, the kingpin slid off the fifthwheel and the 15,000 lbs RV crashed down on our tailgate. It only dented it slightly (it's \\\"Ram Tough!!\\\") but finally the stupid thing was off. Again, this was our first time but we were already dreading hooking up and trying to exit the park at the end of our stay. I was hoping we could make the turn to get out. I think Cathy went back into the RV and did some shots before helping the girls out with school.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7613/16819797595_11fe8bf00c_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfter work we headed to a local RV dealer for some supplies and to have them take a look at the fifthwheel; it was slight cockeyed. Fortunately, they fixed it the 'Merican way with a piece of wood and a really big hammer! Then we headed down to Newport Beach for a dinner of appetizers at the [Newport Beach Brewing Company](http://www.newportbeachbrewingcompany.com/). Afterwards we stopped by Fry's to do a little electronics browsing which was awesome! Not a bad way to finish off a crappy day.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8584/16200035723_31e3a6cfa9_c.jpg)\\n\\nSince we knew we were going to be doing a lot of park hopping, Cathy purchased a 4 day CitiPass pass to Universal Studios, Disneyland and Disney California Adventure (it's sister park next door). After work and school we decided to drive the 5 minutes down to road to do Disneyland for awhile. For some reason we tried to ride all of the rides that make Lexi cry. She always freaks out while in line and then loves the ride once done. This of course makes Cathy insane. We rode the Tower of Terror, California Screamin roller coaster and the Crazy Ferris Wheel, which was a blast!!! We also watched a little Frozen theatre show (super funny) and the \\\"Broadway\\\" production of Aladdin which the girls absolutely loved!! We left at closing time, stopped by Taco Bell on the way home and then hit the sack. We were going to Disneyland again in the morning! I needed my beauty sleep.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8704/16633844419_1b1c8a10dd_c.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday we set off for Disneyland after lunch. After a couple of hours of waiting in lines (they don't offer guest assistance passes), riding the lame rides and **standing up** while watching Fantasmic, we realized that Disneyland ***completely blows*** in comparison to Disneyworld. We'll never go there again.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7608/16643315058_bfb7776024_c.jpg)\\n\\nOn Sunday we decided to get out of the \\\"Disneyland area\\\" and head north of Hollywood to Universal Studios. Even though a couple of the key attractions were closed/broken, we did get a guest assistance pass and had an awesome day. So much better than Disneyland! I especially enjoyed the Backlot Tour where they take you through all of the actual TV and movies sets that are in production. Extremely interesting. \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7612/16820039735_f43cf52c30_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe did this \\\"Thor\\\" tour and Lexi was selected to help pick up Thor's hammer so she got to take part in the show and we had some special photos taken just for us! [The video is really cute!](https://flic.kr/p/skBLsY) The high point in the day for Cathy was when we sent the girls on a couple of rides by themselves and we ate Chinese! Cathy had been craving Chinese food and made everyone eat dinner at Panda Express. The girls were **not** happy.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8607/16661699518_aa38282b0c_c.jpg)\\n\\nMonday I worked all day while Cathy took the girls to Disney California Adventure right after it opened (I was done with theme parks). After work I picked them up and we headed back to the Newport Beach Brewing Company to meet Heinz for a late dinner. It was such a great time catching up with him and he follow us home so we could talk some more and show off our new palace to him. He ended up leaving very late and we (mostly Cathy) went to bed exhausted. \\n\\nTuesday we were heading north so Cathy ran some errands in the morning and we hooked up around noon.

You can drive up the 101 with the ocean on your left and the mountains on your right while driving through wineries and horse farms. You can go for long stretches without civilization as it's still fairly rural. There are also a few really good breweries in the area as well. The area is dotted with small beach towns along the coast frequented by seasonal visitors from the Fresno area. The city of San Luis Obispo has this really cool feel to it. California Polytechnic State University is located there (a lot of smart hipsters) but the population is only 50,000. The downtown area was really fun to walk around and the Thursday night Farmer's Market was a blast! They even have a [yummy gum wall](https://flic.kr/p/rFcovS)!\\n\\nWe pull into the RV spot late afternoon on Tuesday without many issues. We did a pretty good job pulling into our spot but it was somewhat tight so we had to wiggle our way in a little. The RV park was right across the street from the public beach so we walked down to check it out after dinner. You can drive on the beach and it's dunes are a magnet for ATV riders. That's the big attraction for the area. We were definitely going to need to rent some 4-wheelers and go riding!\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7592/16330660593_51f95c5564_c.jpg)\\n\\nThe next couple of days we spent heading into SLO and just hanging out around the beach. We found a couple of cool restaurants for dinner each night and had blast at the Farmer's market. Friday after work and school we headed down to the beach and rented 4-wheelers. Kira and Lexi shared one (Kira rode for only a minute or so and decided she didn't like it) but we ended up bringing Lexi back from the dunes as she kept getting stuck. Hali and I had a blast and rode for a couple of hours. I shot a [great GoPro video](https://flic.kr/p/roQQ65) of us riding. I got the truck stuck in the sand (no 4x4 damn it!!) but fortunately another truck stopped by within seconds to pull me out.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8704/16706703780_69f4fb41e2_c.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday morning we drove 3 hours north to San Jose to drop Cathy and Hali off at the airport for their trip back to Sarasota for some tests. Afterwards I took the girls to the movies and we did some shopping before heading back home. We stopped for dinner just north of SLO at [Firestone Walker Brewing Co](http://www.firestonebeer.com/) which has a great restaurant and some good beers. I just couldn't decide which one of the girls was going to drive us home.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8723/16328360154_1feec86221_c.jpg)\\n\\nCathy spent the next couple of day spending time with family and friends while shuttling Hali to doctors' appointments. She received a call from Brittany that she and Curtis were getting married and she wanted us to come back to Ft. Sill. They were in a hurry so they could get off-post housing before deployments. So we booked a flight for Thursday night and I took the day off for her wedding on Friday. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8726/16280466394_e69222b8ce_c.jpg)\\n\\nBack in California, the girls and I just hung around the RV doing school and work (the girls loved their free time on the computers), playing with toys, going out to eat at night and occasionally getting some time away at the playground while I worked.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8717/16743524187_8394588e68_c.jpg)\\n\\nCathy and Hali flew into San Francisco late Wednesday night so we booked a hotel near the airport. We flew out to Ft. Sill later the next day for the wedding and Brittany and Chelsea met us at the airport. They were super-excited to see us! After getting our passes to enter Ft. Sill, we checked into the Holiday Inn on post and hit the sack. It had been a long day of travel and work!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8712/16326884324_f3292f079a_c.jpg)\\n\\nFriday was the wedding day and we weren't sure if it was actually going to happen. Curtis was in the field and we didn't know if they'd let him come back in for the ceremony. We spent the morning at Wal-Mart buying the girls dresses and shoes for the ceremony. We finally heard from Brittany that the wedding was a go so we met everyone at the Court House around noon. It was a really cute ceremony and there are [some great photos here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffdonthemic/sets/72157652202180932). \\n\\nWe spent the rest of our time in Lawton looking at apartments with Brittany and generally just hanging out with her and Chelsea. Curtis had to head back to the field so unfortunately we didn't see him after the wedding. For some reason I was stupid and booked a return flight to SFO that left at 6am on Sunday! We had to get everyone up and running at 3:30am to make it to the airport on time. Needless to day, everyone slept on the flights home. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8729/17005770012_9dbe0153e5_c.jpg)\\n\\nOur original plans were to do some sight-seeing in San Francisco when we returned for Lawton but instead we stopped in Monterey on our way home. We grabbed some lunch outside at a local brewery and then hit the (really awesome) aquarium for a couple of hours. Afterwards we did the [17-Mile Drive](http://www.seemonterey.com/listings/17-Mile-Drive-/937/) through Pebble Beach stopping along the way at points to enjoy the beauty and take photos. By the time we arrived home, everyone was grumpy and tired from a long day.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7639/16924786086_b19f9e5ea5_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe spent the next couple of day recovering, prepping for our move Wednesday and generally just playing and eating around the house. Wednesday was a normal school and work day and we packed up around noon and headed to Fresno! We really wanted do Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks.\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651756730607%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651756730607%2F&set_id=72157651756730607&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651756730607%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651756730607%2F&set_id=72157651756730607&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: March 17th - April 1st  \\nRV Park: [Coastal Dunes RV Park & Campground](http://www.slocountyparks.org/), Oceana, CA\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We spent nearly two weeks around San Luis Obispo and absolutely loved the area.

Cathy\ntook Hali back to Sarasota for a quick medical checkup and we all headed to Ft.\nSill for Brittany's wedding.\n\n\n\nI really feel in love with the SLO area (San Luis Obispo); It's gorgeous! You\ncan drive up the 101 with the ocean on your left and the mountains on your right\nwhile driving through wineries and horse farms. You can go for long stretches\nwithout civilization as it's still fairly rural. There are also a few really\ngood breweries in the area as well. The area is dotted with small beach towns\nalong the coast frequented by seasonal visitors from the Fresno area. The city\nof San Luis Obispo has this really cool feel to it. California Polytechnic State\nUniversity is located there (a lot of smart hipsters) but the population is only\n50,000. The downtown area was really fun to walk around and the Thursday night\nFarmer's Market was a blast! They even have a yummy gum wall\n[https://flic.kr/p/rFcovS]!\n\nWe pull into the RV spot late afternoon on Tuesday without many issues. We did a\npretty good job pulling into our spot but it was somewhat tight so we had to\nwiggle our way in a little. The RV park was right across the street from the\npublic beach so we walked down to check it out after dinner. You can drive on\nthe beach and it's dunes are a magnet for ATV riders. That's the big attraction\nfor the area. We were definitely going to need to rent some 4-wheelers and go\nriding!\n\n\n\nThe next couple of days we spent heading into SLO and just hanging out around\nthe beach. We found a couple of cool restaurants for dinner each night and had\nblast at the Farmer's market. Friday after work and school we headed down to the\nbeach and rented 4-wheelers. Kira and Lexi shared one (Kira rode for only a\nminute or so and decided she didn't like it) but we ended up bringing Lexi back\nfrom the dunes as she kept getting stuck. Hali and I had a blast and rode for a\ncouple of hours. I shot a great GoPro video [https://flic.kr/p/roQQ65] of us\nriding. I got the truck stuck in the sand (no 4x4 damn it!!) but fortunately\nanother truck stopped by within seconds to pull me out.\n\n\n\nSaturday morning we drove 3 hours north to San Jose to drop Cathy and Hali off\nat the airport for their trip back to Sarasota for some tests. Afterwards I took\nthe girls to the movies and we did some shopping before heading back home. We\nstopped for dinner just north of SLO at Firestone Walker Brewing Co\n[http://www.firestonebeer.com/] which has a great restaurant and some good\nbeers. I just couldn't decide which one of the girls was going to drive us home.\n\n\n\nCathy spent the next couple of day spending time with family and friends while\nshuttling Hali to doctors' appointments. She received a call from Brittany that\nshe and Curtis were getting married and she wanted us to come back to Ft. Sill.\nThey were in a hurry so they could get off-post housing before deployments. So\nwe booked a flight for Thursday night and I took the day off for her wedding on\nFriday.\n\n\n\nBack in California, the girls and I just hung around the RV doing school and\nwork (the girls loved their free time on the computers), playing with toys,\ngoing out to eat at night and occasionally getting some time away at the\nplayground while I worked.\n\n\n\nCathy and Hali flew into San Francisco late Wednesday night so we booked a hotel\nnear the airport. We flew out to Ft. Sill later the next day for the wedding and\nBrittany and Chelsea met us at the airport. They were super-excited to see us!\nAfter getting our passes to enter Ft.

I apologize for not being more expressive but I'm a simple man with simple words.\\n\\nThe journey from San Luis Obispo was somewhat stressful. After being on the road for a few minutes we realized that we only had a half talk of gas and an extremely low tire on the right side of the RV.  To make matters worse the GPS took us on a terrible route an hour or so through the mountains on a super windy, narrow road. We were afraid we'd either run out of gas or flip the RV. It was so rural that we probably saw less than 20 cars during that portion of the route. We finally hit the major highway (the one we *should* have been on) and found a gas station to fill up and put some air in our tire. The remainder of the trip was uneventful as there's virtually nothing between SLO and Fresno; just farmland. Fortunately the RV spot was easy to pull into and after setting up, we headed into Fresno to run some errands and eat dinner at [Sequoia Brewery](http://sequoiabrewing.com/). We sat out back on the patio in the setting sun with good food and good beer!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8696/17032205031_da57621949_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfter work on Thursday we took the short drive to Sequoia National Park. It was abolutely gorgeous so don't skip the pictures below. In retrospect I enjoyed Sequoia more that Yosemite. The trees are absolutely amazing and I think I've been converted to a \\\"tree hugger\\\". I found it fascinating that these giant trees have been growing for centuries only on one side of the Sierra Nevada mountain. We drove through a stretch of the forest that was on fire (on purpose) so it was a good teaching moment to describe how fire is actually beneficial to the growth of these trees. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8698/16845201790_d1e6b72633_c.jpg)\\n\\nOur first stop was [The General Sherman Tree](http://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/sherman.htm). It was also probably 30 degrees colder in the groves than when we entered the park so it was a nice walk. There's no doubt why it's the \\\"General\\\"; it's massive and words don't do it justice. We walked through the trees for an hour or so taking a bunch of pictures and just soaking in the forest. They've done a great job building a tourist path to the trees without disturbing the forest so it's a nice little hike.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7646/16844735658_37b86c0f1e_c.jpg)\\n\\nOur next stop on the way back out of the park was at [Moro Rock](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g143050-d146443-Reviews-Moro_Rock-Sequoia_and_Kings_Canyon_National_Park_California.html) which has an amazing view of the park. I think it's the highest point in the park? The path and steps to the top are steep and narrow and Kira wanted no part of it. We had to take a couple of breaks for her. We encouraged her to keep going but [she refused to go to the very top](https://flic.kr/p/roWxs3) so I ended up staying with her while everyone else continued on. The girls loved the view from the top and said it was \\\"amazing\\\". Check out the videos below.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7633/16846511609_fbe767dcd5_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfterwards we made our way out of the park (stopping along the way for too many selfies) and found a small restaurant on the river for a late dinner. Dinner wasn't fantastic but the view was. We entertained the girls by asking them a series of ethical questions. There was a 13 year old boy bussing tables and delivering food who kept stopping by to see if we needed anything. I gave him a hard time and asked what his intentions were with my daughter.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8709/16844758238_15570e4335_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfter school on Friday Cathy colored Easter eggs with the girls and we took off for dinner in Fresno. We headed to the north side of town where all of the new develoment is located (it's quite nice!) and had an awesome dinner at [Westwoods Barbecue and Spice Company](http://westwoodsbbq.com/). The little girls didn't bring any dolls/toys to play with so they improvised with sugar packets and salt shakers. The food was great and our waiter was really nice, even though he was Canadian. We talked about our trip and being foster parents and he told another table of our conversation (I think they were friends?) and they bought us a round of drinks. We complimented the manager on his restaurant and he gave the girls a free bag of ginormous cookies. Great night!! We ran a few quick errands and then headed home for bed. We were spendingh the weekend in Yosemite so I needed my beauty sleep.\\n\\nSaturday morning we took off around 9am for Yosemite with the intentions of spending the night and doing Yosemite again on Sunday, if we could find a hotel. If not we'd just drive home. The 3+ hour drive wasn't bad until we were a mile from the park gates and then it slowed to a crawl. We found out that Yosemite is extremely crowded with visitors... to the point that it's almost not worth the trip. We stopped at the Wawona Hotel to see if they have any vacancies (they didn't) and grab some lunch in the restaurnt.  Afterwards we immediately headed towards the village marveling at the awesome scenery. It was a beautiful, sunny day and we immediatly came to the realization that everyone had the same idea as us... \\\"let's go to Yosemite!\\\" We drove around for about 30 minutes looking for a place to park before we made our own spot on the side of the road next to one of the campgrounds. \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7663/17054587866_5d1b16616c_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe filled up our camelbacks and headed on a hike up the mountain to see the [Upper Yosemite Falls](http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yosemitefallstrail.htm). The path wound its way up the mountain and was uneven and rocky. Much harder than we anticipated. Kira did well but after 90 minutes we decided to take a few pictures at the scenic pass for the falls (it was actually super nice!) and head back down instead of climbing another hour or two to the top. The path was crowded with people going both ways and we saw some crazy things. We passed a lady descending the mountain with a 2yr old on her shoulders. Definitely not a way to carry your kid down the side of a mountain. Cathy almost grabbed the baby and carried it herself.\\n\\nEveryone was exhausted when we made it to the bottom so we made the hour drive out of the park to try and find a hotel. It was about 7pm when we hit civilation and found an (overpriced) hotel with rooms available. After getting checked in we found the [South Gate Brewing Company](http://southgatebrewco.com/) and grabbed some food while watched UK lose in the final four. \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7674/16862592249_bce44491c6_c.jpg)\\n\\nThe next morning everyone woke up late and took their time getting ready for our day in the park. I left to get McDonald's for breakfast, subs for lunch and more water for the camelbacks. We beat the traffic to the park and headed back to the village. It was Easter Sunday and there were far fewer people at the park, even in the afternoon. We'd read about a hike with a paved path around [Mirror Lake](http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/mirrorlaketrail.htm) so we decided to give that a try. It turned out to be a pretty steep climb at certain points and Kira wasn't having fun at all. After 45 minutes I made an executive decision and asked Cathy if we could turn around. We finally got back to the truck and decided it was time for a picnic.\\n\\nOur next stop was the awesome [Tunnel View](http://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/nature/scenic-vistas-tunnel-view.htm), probably my favorite part of the park. We walked around and took pictures and finally hopped back in the truck for lunch. It was a little too windy for Cathy so I parked the truck facing Yosemite Valley, El Capitan, Bridalveil Falls, and Half Dome; and we ate our subs while staring at some of the best scenery in the world.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7615/17079877912_a851458174_c.jpg)\\n\\nOur next and last stop was [Glacier Point](http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/glacierpoint.htm) for a spectactular view of Half Dome. It was an hour or so drive and 3000+ feet higher than the Valley floor.  It was cold, probably in the high 30's, and we weren't prepared; I was still wearing shorts. Kira wasn't happy at all. We ducked into the gift shop to pick up some trinkets while trying to stay warm. We took one more quick peek and, literally, ran back to the truck and drove the three hours home.\\n\\nMonday and Tuesday were typical days and we slowly recovered from the weekend. School and work and then out for dinner each night. Monday we found a nice little brewery ([Brewbakers](http://brewbakersbrewingco.com/food.htm)) in Vasalia and then we wandered into the  Fresno Tap House Grill Tuesday night. It just happened to be National Beer Day and with 130+ beers on tap I celebrated accordingly.\\n\\nOn Wednesday we pulled out of our late in the afternoon and discovered that our tire was again almost flat. We added some fix-a-flat and limped to the gas station to fill it up with air. We didn't make it. What a disaster....\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651800567389%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651800567389%2F&set_id=72157651800567389&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651800567389%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651800567389%2F&set_id=72157651800567389&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: April 1st - March 8th  \\nRV Park: [Viking RV Park](http://www.missionbayrvresort.com), Kingsburg, CA\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If you look at our <a href=\"http://www.jeffdouglas.com/map\">route on the map</a> you'll notice that Freso is a little off our beaten trail.

We were spendingh the weekend in Yosemite so I needed my beauty sleep.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning we took off around 9am for Yosemite with the intentions of spending the night and doing Yosemite again on Sunday, if we could find a hotel. If not we'd just drive home. The 3+ hour drive wasn't bad until we were a mile from the park gates and then it slowed to a crawl. We found out that Yosemite is extremely crowded with visitors... to the point that it's almost not worth the trip. We stopped at the Wawona Hotel to see if they have any vacancies (they didn't) and grab some lunch in the restaurnt.  Afterwards we immediately headed towards the village marveling at the awesome scenery. It was a beautiful, sunny day and we immediatly came to the realization that everyone had the same idea as us... &quot;let's go to Yosemite!&quot; We drove around for about 30 minutes looking for a place to park before we made our own spot on the side of the road next to one of the campgrounds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7663/17054587866_5d1b16616c_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>We filled up our camelbacks and headed on a hike up the mountain to see the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yosemitefallstrail.htm\">Upper Yosemite Falls</a>.

Kira did well but after 90 minutes we decided to take a few pictures at the scenic pass for the falls (it was actually super nice!) and head back down instead of climbing another hour or two to the top. The path was crowded with people going both ways and we saw some crazy things. We passed a lady descending the mountain with a 2yr old on her shoulders.

I left to get McDonald's for breakfast, subs for lunch and more water for the camelbacks. We beat the traffic to the park and headed back to the village.

We'd read about a hike with a paved path around <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/mirrorlaketrail.htm\">Mirror Lake</a> so we decided to give that a try. It turned out to be a pretty steep climb at certain points and Kira wasn't having fun at all. After 45 minutes I made an executive decision and asked Cathy if we could turn around.

We discussed skipping Fresno\nand pushing on to San Francisco but I lobbied hard for the stop as I really \nwanted to visit Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks. Cathy's plan was to visit\nthem next summer since it was a couple of hours out of our way but I finally I\nwon her over by groveling.\n\n> The words \"amazing\" and \"awesome\" are used throughout this blog post but are\nquite applicable. I apologize for not being more expressive but I'm a simple man\nwith simple words.\n\n\nThe journey from San Luis Obispo was somewhat stressful. After being on the road\nfor a few minutes we realized that we only had a half talk of gas and an\nextremely low tire on the right side of the RV. To make matters worse the GPS\ntook us on a terrible route an hour or so through the mountains on a super\nwindy, narrow road. We were afraid we'd either run out of gas or flip the RV. It\nwas so rural that we probably saw less than 20 cars during that portion of the\nroute. We finally hit the major highway (the one we should have been on) and\nfound a gas station to fill up and put some air in our tire. The remainder of\nthe trip was uneventful as there's virtually nothing between SLO and Fresno;\njust farmland. Fortunately the RV spot was easy to pull into and after setting\nup, we headed into Fresno to run some errands and eat dinner at Sequoia Brewery\n[http://sequoiabrewing.com/]. We sat out back on the patio in the setting sun\nwith good food and good beer!\n\n\n\nAfter work on Thursday we took the short drive to Sequoia National Park. It was\nabolutely gorgeous so don't skip the pictures below. In retrospect I enjoyed\nSequoia more that Yosemite. The trees are absolutely amazing and I think I've\nbeen converted to a \"tree hugger\". I found it fascinating that these giant trees\nhave been growing for centuries only on one side of the Sierra Nevada mountain.\nWe drove through a stretch of the forest that was on fire (on purpose) so it was\na good teaching moment to describe how fire is actually beneficial to the growth\nof these trees.\n\n\n\nOur first stop was The General Sherman Tree\n[http://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/sherman.htm]. It was also probably 30\ndegrees colder in the groves than when we entered the park so it was a nice\nwalk. There's no doubt why it's the \"General\"; it's massive and words don't do\nit justice. We walked through the trees for an hour or so taking a bunch of\npictures and just soaking in the forest. They've done a great job building a\ntourist path to the trees without disturbing the forest so it's a nice little\nhike.\n\n\n\nOur next stop on the way back out of the park was at Moro Rock\n[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g143050-d146443-Reviews-Moro_Rock-Sequoia_and_Kings_Canyon_National_Park_California.html] \nwhich has an amazing view of the park. I think it's the highest point in the\npark? The path and steps to the top are steep and narrow and Kira wanted no part\nof it. We had to take a couple of breaks for her. We encouraged her to keep\ngoing but she refused to go to the very top [https://flic.kr/p/roWxs3] so I\nended up staying with her while everyone else continued on. The girls loved the\nview from the top and said it was \"amazing\". Check out the videos below.\n\n\n\nAfterwards we made our way out of the park (stopping along the way for too many\nselfies) and found a small restaurant on the river for a late dinner. Dinner\nwasn't fantastic but the view was. We entertained the girls by asking them a\nseries of ethical questions. There was a 13 year old boy bussing tables and\ndelivering food who kept stopping by to see if we needed anything. I gave him a\nhard time and asked what his intentions were with my daughter.\n\n\n\nAfter school on Friday Cathy colored Easter eggs with the girls and we took off\nfor dinner in Fresno. We headed to the north side of town where all of the new\ndeveloment is located (it's quite nice!) and had an awesome dinner at Westwoods\nBarbecue and Spice Company [http://westwoodsbbq.com/]. The little girls didn't\nbring any dolls/toys to play with so they improvised with sugar packets and salt\nshakers. The food was great and our waiter was really nice, even though he was\nCanadian. We talked about our trip and being foster parents and he told another\ntable of our conversation (I think they were friends?) and they bought us a\nround of drinks. We complimented the manager on his restaurant and he gave the\ngirls a free bag of ginormous cookies. Great night!! We ran a few quick errands\nand then headed home for bed.

Definitely not a\nway to carry your kid down the side of a mountain. Cathy almost grabbed the baby\nand carried it herself.\n\nEveryone was exhausted when we made it to the bottom so we made the hour drive\nout of the park to try and find a hotel. It was about 7pm when we hit civilation\nand found an (overpriced) hotel with rooms available. After getting checked in\nwe found the South Gate Brewing Company [http://southgatebrewco.com/] and\ngrabbed some food while watched UK lose in the final four.\n\n\n\nThe next morning everyone woke up late and took their time getting ready for our\nday in the park.

We noticed as we were pulling out of our spot that one of the RV tires was extremely low again. It had been giving us issues so I had purchased a can of fix-a-flat just in case. So we filled the tire with the entire can and headed off to the nearest truck stop a mile or two down the road to see if that would do the trick. Our GPS couldn't find the truck stop very well so it took us the long way through some back roads. About a half mile away we hit some railroad tracks and the tire shredded; I could see smoke in the side view mirror.  As we limped down the road we realized that there was a semi tire store right before the truck stop! I must be Irish! I had Cathy run in and see if they could fix our tire.

Our son Scott was in town for work and we had plans to meet up with him at [21st Amendment](http://21st-amendment.com/) for dinner. I hadn't seen him in a couple of months so it was great catching up. We made plans to spend a couple of more night together but it didn't pan out due to his work. He's becoming so grown up!!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8723/17111110972_83bdb870a7_b.jpg)\\n\\nAfter work on Thursday we caught the last boat to Alcatraz and had a blast touring the island. The audio tour was great and everyone really enjoyed it. Kira freaked out a little when they started slamming the cell doors but all in all it was a lot of fun and their girls still talk about it all the time. Afterwards walked down to Pier 39 for dinner and a quick peek at the seals.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7596/17112433295_4ac25fed37_c.jpg)\\n\\nFriday night we had plans to head to San Jose to have dinner with my Salesforce buddy, Pat Patterson, and his family; they have two boys the same ages as the girls. The kids played, we ate bbq, drank craft beer and talked about work and kids. An awesome evening but a long drive!!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8741/16513917073_3fe440e35b_c.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday we got up late and headed down to the Golden Gate Bridge. Before walking the bridge we stopped off in Sausalito at [Marin Brewing Company](www.marinbrewing.com/) for lunch and a couple of craft beers. The food and beer was great and we enjoyed some time in the sun on their patio. It took us three passes over the bridge until we finally found a parking place! We walked to the other end of the bridge, had a snack and then back. It was a 3.4 mile journey both ways but the girls didn't seem to mind. We took some great photos along the way.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7587/16952845240_2a54b016a4_c.jpg)\\n\\nSunday was wine day so we headed to Sonoma! We'd had some stuff shipped to my buddy Sal's house in Santa Rosa so that was another reason to head north for the day.  We looked for family friendly wineries and our first stop was [Larson Family Winery](http://www.larsonfamilywinery.com).  A beautiful, relaxing place with picnic tables, cornhole and other games for the kids. Plus the weather was gorgeous! Our waitress was from Bradenton so we immediately became best friends and she rarely left our table. We spent more time there than we planned (we had such a great time!) so we decided to visit my favorite winery, Sunce, and then call it a day. We had tenative plans with Sal and his family for dinner. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8799/16520221593_27e821e6e4_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfter Sunce we drove through Santa Rosa and came across [Russian River Brewing Company](http://russianriverbrewing.com), the mecca for craft beer. The wait wasn't long so I texted Sal to see if they wanted to join us. Unfortunately their plans had gone long and they couldn't it so we put our name on the list and then headed next door to buy the girls some new books. I wasn't as impressed with the brewery or beer as I had anticipated but perhaps my expectations were too high. All I hear about from my CA friends is how RRBC is the best ever, Pliny the Elder is the best IPA ever, blah, blah. It was really good but I'd been to better breweries with better beer.  However, the girls had new books. I had some great craft beer. Everyone was happy. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8711/17133460891_c6343b9b63_c.jpg)\\n\\nOn our way home we stopped by Sal's house for a couple of hours to pick up our stuff (nerf bars for the truck and various stuff from the Appirio company store) and catch up. His wife was fantastic (she's an ER doctor) and we had a blast with them. We hated leaving.\\n\\nThe rest of our stay in San Francisco was uneventful. We had good intention to head into the city Monday and/or Tuesday but we just cound't muster the energy. After school and work we just didn't ***feel*** like doing anything, let along fighting traffic, and stayed around the house. Wednesday we packed up as usual and headed north to camp in the Giant Redwoods!\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651809427150%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651809427150%2F&set_id=72157651809427150&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651809427150%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157651809427150%2F&set_id=72157651809427150&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: April 8st - April 15th  \\nRV Park: [Tradewinds RV Park](http://www.tradewindsrvpark.net), Vallejo , CA\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We spent a week in San Francisco but ended up not doing much in the city.

I know\nit's an awesome place but I work there and Cathy is not a fan of the weather.\nTherefore her contempt for the weather transfers to the city itself. We had\nplans to go into the city more often (it was only 30 minutes away) but the\nthought of fighting traffic didn't appeal to me. We did make an awesome trip to\nSonoma which was probably the highlight of our trip.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately our journey from Fresno to San Francisco start off terribly. We\nnoticed as we were pulling out of our spot that one of the RV tires was\nextremely low again. It had been giving us issues so I had purchased a can of\nfix-a-flat just in case. So we filled the tire with the entire can and headed\noff to the nearest truck stop a mile or two down the road to see if that would\ndo the trick. Our GPS couldn't find the truck stop very well so it took us the\nlong way through some back roads. About a half mile away we hit some railroad\ntracks and the tire shredded; I could see smoke in the side view mirror. As we\nlimped down the road we realized that there was a semi tire store right before\nthe truck stop! I must be Irish! I had Cathy run in and see if they could fix\nour tire. I thought we'd have much better luck if I send in the hot red-head to\nask for help. Luckily 60 minutes and $60 later we were back on the road to San\nFrancisco! Crisis averted!\n\nWe arrived at the RV park a little later than expected and had some difficulties\npulling into our spot. We couldn't quite make the turn into our spot so Cathy\nwanted me to go around the row and pull in the from the other direction.\nHowever, I was confident that I could back the RV into the spot.... which I did\nlike a boss! Cathy was a mess during the entire process. Luckily I had hide my\nbourbon. The RV park was nice but right next to the highway in a somewhat\nsketchy area. Cathy and I ran almost everyday up and down the road parallel to\nthe highway and, in retrospect, may not have been the safest thing to do.\n\n\n\nAfter we pulled into our spot and setup we headed into the city. Our son Scott\nwas in town for work and we had plans to meet up with him at 21st Amendment\n[http://21st-amendment.com/] for dinner. I hadn't seen him in a couple of months\nso it was great catching up. We made plans to spend a couple of more night\ntogether but it didn't pan out due to his work. He's becoming so grown up!!\n\n\n\nAfter work on Thursday we caught the last boat to Alcatraz and had a blast\ntouring the island. The audio tour was great and everyone really enjoyed it.\nKira freaked out a little when they started slamming the cell doors but all in\nall it was a lot of fun and their girls still talk about it all the time.\nAfterwards walked down to Pier 39 for dinner and a quick peek at the seals.\n\n\n\nFriday night we had plans to head to San Jose to have dinner with my Salesforce\nbuddy, Pat Patterson, and his family; they have two boys the same ages as the\ngirls. The kids played, we ate bbq, drank craft beer and talked about work and\nkids. An awesome evening but a long drive!!\n\n\n\nSaturday we got up late and headed down to the Golden Gate Bridge.

Most of the coast is pretty isolated and according to my friend in Portland, it's the \\\"place to go if you want to escape the law and live off the grid\\\". The coast is dotted with beaches, little villages and that's about it. There's not a lot to do during the off season, however we did have a good time in retrospect even though the weather was a little cold, windy and sometimes rainy. \\n\\nPort Orford was a 4 hour drive from Myers Flat, CA and one of the first cities you come to as you cross the state line. There wasn't much in Port Orford... maybe 5 restaurants, a grocery store and a hardware store. It wasn't season yet and most of the shops were still closed. The best part of Port Orford is that they have an extremely loud tsunami siren that goes off each day at noon. Apparently people in Oregon are paranoid about natural disasters. \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7700/17053253550_ab09dd55c8_c.jpg)\\n\\nThe RV park was really nice and the owner walked us out to our super easy to get into pull through. For dinner he recommended [Griff's on the Dock](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Griffs-On-The-Dock/173346272724649)  so we headed there after getting setup for a late dinner. We had a hard time finding the tiny shack as it was literally *out on the dock* next to the boats. \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7709/17086687047_4c4c0d71ee_c.jpg)\\n\\nMost of our time in Port Orford was spent with school, work and watching \\\"Schoolhouse Rock\\\" videos  but occasionally we'd ventured out for some fun stuff and food. We'd walk the block or two into \\\"town\\\" to pick up dinner or down by the beach see the rocks and waves. Not an exciting time in Port Orford but we needed the downtime.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8810/17270464232_b2844209eb_c.jpg)\\n\\nCathy always tries to keep us busy with fun, educational activities, (she's awesome!) so after work on Friday we drove 5 miles or so down the road to visit the [Cape Blanco Lighthouse](http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=44). It was only 63 steps but still pretty impressive from the top. We got a private tour (we were the only one there!) from a couple of volunteers but, unfortunately, Cathy and I found it more interesting than the girls did. It was a impressive view and we tried to get the girls a job washing windows but no takers. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8725/17292326762_05d8852f02_c.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday was a full day of activities! Cathy wanted to head an hour or so north to Coos Bay as there was a mall there and she wanted to take Hali clothes shopping for her birthday. On the way north we stopped at the [West Coast Game Park Safari](http://www.westcoastgameparksafari.com) and had an absolute blast! **Check out the pictures below** but the girls had an oppotunity to see a tiger up close; pet baby bears, a lynx, a possum, ferrets, baby foxes, a baby sheep; and feed the goats and peacocks. The girls absolutely loved it!! Afterwards we headed further north to Coos Bay and I entertained the two little girls while mommy spent some quality time shopping with Hali. After that we hit a little hole-in-the-wall pizza joint, killing time before the movie \\\"Home\\\" started. It was a long drive back home but everyone was still excited from the day.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7765/17139948250_2740bccedc_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfter school on Monday we went a local faux [Prehistoric Gardens](http://www.prehistoricgardens.com). It was roughly a 30 minute walk through the beautiful forest and the girls had fun looking at all of the dinosaur \\\"exhibits\\\" and talking about Bigfoot. Everyone participated in the argument whether or not Bigfoot is real (he is!!) and it became very heated.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7668/17140443859_46b43ca75c_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfterwards we killed some time on the near [Kissing Rock](http://www.trulia.com/property/3110492549--Kissing-Rock-Gold-Beach-OR-97444). Cathy and I took a walk along the beach while the girls stayed in the truck on their computers. I made rock angels and we took some selfies while walking up and down the beach. The girls had been asking for a pet for a number of weeks so Cathy and I decided to find some \\\"pet rocks\\\" for them. Hali and Lexi really loved theirs (Hali carries hers all the time) but Kira wasn't impessed whatsoever. When I asked her what she named her rock she said, \\\"I named it Richard cause I don't like him. I don't want a rock. I want a dog\\\". It was finally dinner time and we found the brewery we were looking for which turned out to not have a restaurant or be open. So we punted and headed back to Port Orford for probably the worst meal we'd had in a long time. Still a good evening.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8745/17119398687_00952a451f_c.jpg)\\n\\nLate Tuesday afternoon we packed up in the slight rain and headed four hours north to Lincoln City, the vacation destination for Portlandiers. The RV park was nice but we had a few issues with it. We had to pull a little wide to get our long RV around the corner of our spot and almost got stuck in the grass. In retrospect I wish we'd have purchased a 4x4 for these types of situations. Also, the RV park was on the side of a hill and we did an extremely bad job of leveling King Kong. I had to get inside and help push one of the slide-outs out as the motor couldn't handle the angle. Plus, food and beverages (mostly root beer and olives) fell out of the refrigerator and onto the floor shattering glass all over the place. Cathy was hot!!! So after getting everything cleaned up and put into place, we drove 30 minutes north to [Pelican Brewery](http://www.yourlittlebeachtown.com/pelican) in Pacific City for dinner. Going to a brewery for dinner always makes Cathy feel better. The brewery **was** the city and it was located right on the beach. The food and beer was great and the view was spectacular!\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7738/17141005659_4d3c7dfea7_c.jpg)\\n\\nWednesday after school and work we decided to drive back south to the famous [Sea Lion Caves](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g51867-d286030-Reviews-Sea_Lion_Caves-Florence_Oregon.html)! For some reason, Cathy **really** wanted to see those damned sea lions. She called ahead to make sure there were sea lions lounging about and was assured that there were plenty to see. So we hopped in the truck and took the two hour scenic route down the coast (everything is a scenic route in Oregon!) only to find that the \\\"attraction\\\" was closed. Apparently the elevator had just broken and no one was able to see the sea lions! Oh well.. they did give us a free cup of coffee for our troubles. So we hopped back in the truck stopped at [Cape Perpetua](http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recarea/?recid=42265) on the way home for a few minutes. We took a ton of great pictures!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8839/17138757588_c3c6304256_c.jpg)\\n\\nTo break up the long drive we stopped in Newport at the [Rogue Brewery](http://www.rogue.com/) for dinner.  You can get Rogue beer nationally so I've always been a fan and I was super excited to stop. It was really cool to walk through the actual brewery on the way to the restaurant, and as experienced brewers, Hali and I were impressed!! The beer was great and so was the food. They have the **best** chowder and when I commented on it to the waitress she gave me a free cup to take home! I love breweries!\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7680/17326694915_c7248c531b_c.jpg)\\n\\nSince I'd partaken too much of the local fare, I let Cathy drive home. She's very competitive and since I'd dropped the house on the truck in Anaheim, she had to one-up me. So for some reason when we got home she felt the need to back the truck into our spot instead of pulling in as usual. Well, she relied too much on the backup camera and beepers and gently \\\"tapped\\\" the tailgate on the RV. Apparently the RV was higher than the sensors and it didn't pick it up as a obstacle. It wasn't that bad of a dent but the big problem was that we were leaving in two days and we couldn't get the tailgate down to hook up the RV! Yikes!\\n\\nThe next day I had a lunchtime appointment with a podiatrist to have my feet look at as I was still suffering from plantar fasciitis. After he hooked me up with insoles and instructions, I found a local garage and they were able to beat the crap out of the tailgate until they got it opened. Crisis averted! I called around to see how and where we could get a new tailgate but we decided to wait until we are back in Sarasota to get it fixed. At least we could leave for Portland the next day!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8795/17119805337_e132762168_c.jpg)\\n\\nThat evening we celebrated Hali's 13th birthday. She had been counting down the days for almost a month now and it was driving me crazy! She was finally a teenager and now we could officially begin to loathe her.  She opted for pizza in the RV instead of going out and everyone had fun singing and blowing out candles. She got a bunch of clothes and gift cards and was very happy to **finally** be a teenager. \\n\\nOn Friday afternoon we hooked up, pulled out with no issues and made our way to Portland.\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653084312715%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653084312715%2F&set_id=72157653084312715&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653084312715%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653084312715%2F&set_id=72157653084312715&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157650753867973%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157650753867973%2F&set_id=72157650753867973&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157650753867973%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157650753867973%2F&set_id=72157650753867973&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: April 21st - April 28th  \\nRV Park: [Camp Blanco RV Park](http://www.campblanco.com), Port Orford, OR\\n\\nDates: April 28th - May 1st  \\nRV Park: [Devils Lake RV Park](http://www.devilslakervpark.com), Lincoln City, OR\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We made two stops along the gorgeous Oregon coast, one in [Port Orford](That evening we celebrated ) and the other in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lincoln+City,+OR/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54ea8d760b76bd77:0x71530e6a7d2ce862?sa=X&amp;ei=dyZmVf-kKpH3oASvsoCQDA&amp;ved=0CJIBEPIBMBA\">Lincoln City</a>.

Still a good\nevening.\n\n\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon we packed up in the slight rain and headed four hours\nnorth to Lincoln City, the vacation destination for Portlandiers. The RV park\nwas nice but we had a few issues with it. We had to pull a little wide to get\nour long RV around the corner of our spot and almost got stuck in the grass. In\nretrospect I wish we'd have purchased a 4x4 for these types of situations. Also,\nthe RV park was on the side of a hill and we did an extremely bad job of\nleveling King Kong. I had to get inside and help push one of the slide-outs out\nas the motor couldn't handle the angle. Plus, food and beverages (mostly root\nbeer and olives) fell out of the refrigerator and onto the floor shattering\nglass all over the place. Cathy was hot!!! So after getting everything cleaned\nup and put into place, we drove 30 minutes north to Pelican Brewery\n[http://www.yourlittlebeachtown.com/pelican] in Pacific City for dinner. Going\nto a brewery for dinner always makes Cathy feel better. The brewery was the city\nand it was located right on the beach. The food and beer was great and the view\nwas spectacular!\n\n\n\nWednesday after school and work we decided to drive back south to the famous \nSea\nLion Caves\n[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g51867-d286030-Reviews-Sea_Lion_Caves-Florence_Oregon.html]\n! For some reason, Cathy really wanted to see those damned sea lions. She called\nahead to make sure there were sea lions lounging about and was assured that\nthere were plenty to see. So we hopped in the truck and took the two hour scenic\nroute down the coast (everything is a scenic route in Oregon!) only to find that\nthe \"attraction\" was closed. Apparently the elevator had just broken and no one\nwas able to see the sea lions! Oh well.. they did give us a free cup of coffee\nfor our troubles. So we hopped back in the truck stopped at Cape Perpetua\n[http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recarea/?recid=42265] on the way home\nfor a few minutes. We took a ton of great pictures!\n\n\n\nTo break up the long drive we stopped in Newport at the Rogue Brewery\n[http://www.rogue.com/] for dinner. You can get Rogue beer nationally so I've\nalways been a fan and I was super excited to stop. It was really cool to walk\nthrough the actual brewery on the way to the restaurant, and as experienced\nbrewers, Hali and I were impressed!! The beer was great and so was the food.\nThey have the best chowder and when I commented on it to the waitress she gave\nme a free cup to take home! I love breweries!\n\n\n\nSince I'd partaken too much of the local fare, I let Cathy drive home. She's\nvery competitive and since I'd dropped the house on the truck in Anaheim, she\nhad to one-up me. So for some reason when we got home she felt the need to back\nthe truck into our spot instead of pulling in as usual. Well, she relied too\nmuch on the backup camera and beepers and gently \"tapped\" the tailgate on the\nRV. Apparently the RV was higher than the sensors and it didn't pick it up as a\nobstacle. It wasn't that bad of a dent but the big problem was that we were\nleaving in two days and we couldn't get the tailgate down to hook up the RV!\nYikes!\n\nThe next day I had a lunchtime appointment with a podiatrist to have my feet\nlook at as I was still suffering from plantar fasciitis. After he hooked me up\nwith insoles and instructions, I found a local garage and they were able to beat\nthe crap out of the tailgate until they got it opened. Crisis averted! I called\naround to see how and where we could get a new tailgate but we decided to wait\nuntil we are back in Sarasota to get it fixed. At least we could leave for\nPortland the next day!\n\n\n\nThat evening we celebrated Hali's 13th birthday. She had been counting down the\ndays for almost a month now and it was driving me crazy! She was finally a\nteenager and now we could officially begin to loathe her. She opted for pizza in\nthe RV instead of going out and everyone had fun singing and blowing out\ncandles. She got a bunch of clothes and gift cards and was very happy to finally \nbe a teenager.\n\nOn Friday afternoon we hooked up, pulled out with no issues and made our way to\nPortland.\n\n \n\n \n\nDates: April 21st - April 28th\nRV Park: Camp Blanco RV Park [http://www.campblanco.com], Port Orford, OR\n\nDates: April 28th - May 1st\nRV Park: Devils Lake RV Park [http://www.devilslakervpark.com], Lincoln City, OR","feature_image":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7624/17271748981_244782009c_c.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-05-27T19:48:53.000Z","updated_at":"2015-05-27T20:00:40.000Z","published_at":"2015-05-27T20:00:29.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f30","uuid":"22b8c530-17da-4ddf-8d8b-b6c89bad492f","title":"Keeping Portland Weird","slug":"portland-or","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Portland is my kind of town! Luckily the weather was beautiful the entire 10 days we were there so Cathy was partial to it as well. The area is nice, the traffic isn't too bad and there's a lot to do for families. It was a great stop for us. Since Portland is \\\"Beer Country\\\" we did a lot of \\\"beer things\\\" like hitting the local breweries for dinner and hanging out with friends at pubs (I have a bunch of Appirians and ex-Appirians there). I loved Portland and can't wait to go back!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8722/16883705403_b091f48c9f_c.jpg)\\n\\nOur two hour drive to the RV park took an extra hour as we hit rush hour traffic on the south side of Portland. The RV park was actually just north over the bidge in Vancouver, WA so it was a looonnnggg journey. Our spot couldn't have been easier to get into and after quickly setting up we headed to [McMenamins on the Columbia](http://www.mcmenamins.com/299-mcmenamins-on-the-columbia-home) which is a local brewery with awesome outside patio dining. We walked up and down the river until our table was ready and then had a great dinner before heading home for bed.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8725/16881479024_17d4f871bb_c.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday was the day that Hali and I had been anticipating for a week or two! We were going to brew our beer! I had ordered an IPA beer kit from the Appirio company store and we had finally found some pots big enough to actually make beer in the RV. Our first batch would be called \\\"Jali RV IPA\\\" ... or \\\"Jeff and Hali IPA\\\" or .. if Hali drinks this beer \\\"I'll go to Jail-y IPA\\\". We spent almost the entire morning (3 hours?) brewing beer and learning some science along the way. We made a hot mess of the kitchen (water and beer and stuff all over the floor and stove) so Cathy quietly excused herself so she would't have to look at the destruction we'd wrought. Hali was my assistant brewmaster and did a great job cooking the wort, watching the pot and adding some hops while I ran out for a funnel and some ice. After it was done cooling we poured it into in the gallon glass jug and stuck it in the closet so the yeast could work it's magic. Hali was so proud of herself and brags to everyone how she knows how to make beer. Best. Morning. Evar!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8805/17316275508_8655617cff_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfter we cleaned up the house and ourselves, we took off an hour or so east to [Multnomah Falls](http://www.oregon.com/attractions/multnomah_falls) as a number of people had suggested we not miss it. The falls were awesome but crowded. We bathed in their majesty for awhile and then got hot chocolate and snacks before loading back into the truck and heading home to relax and play for the afternoon.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8732/17477806566_9a6a5ee038_c.jpg)\\n\\nOn Sunday we decided to head into Portland to see the city. We got a tip from a buddy to walk down by the river as there was a Cinco de Mayo festival going on plus the weekly arts & crafts fair.\\tThe walk was quite lovely but we really had fun browsing the \\\"weird\\\" booths at the arts and crafts fair. I honestly think we stopped at every booth. We then walked a block past the fair and had a snack at the Thirsty Bear; sitting on the sidewalk in the sun just watching people. Afterwards we noticed a huge line around the corner at [Voodoo Donuts](http://voodoodoughnut.com). We'd never heard of it before but apparently it's **big** on the Food Network. We waited in line for 20 minutes for our pink box of donuts and then ate till we were sick. Later that night we met our friends Matt and Ruth at [Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/locations/portland) and ended up stay roughly 3 hours just chatting away and catching up.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8746/16883899753_ce03f5e4bb_c.jpg)\\n\\nThe rest of the week was more or less work and school as usual. We did find [Washington Park](http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?&propertyid=841&action=viewpark) one night and let the girls play for awhile to burn off some energy. They were super funny and the park was beautiful! Matt had invited me to play card later in the week so I had Cathy drop me off at another brewery (there 52 in Oregon!!) to meet up with Matt, Ruth and some of their friends. I'm not a big card player but it was a lot of fun and I had the opportunity to try some new beer. I marked the night down in the win column.\\n\\n![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/16884135053_7b9a4473b6_c.jpg)\\n\\nThursday night we met over at Matt and Ruth's house and then walked down the street to the [Kennedy School](http://www.mcmenamins.com/427-kennedy-school-home). Apparently the McMenamins brothers buy old property and turn them into restaurants and such. They'd taken a historic elementary school and turned it into something completely awesome!! We absolutely feel in love with the place and had a blast!\\n\\n> Since its 1915 opening, this historic elementary school has been a beloved fixture of its Northeast Portland neighborhood. McMenamins renovated the once-abandoned scholastic gem and turned it into Portland's most unique hotel. Here you'll find 57 comfy guestrooms with private baths and telephones (some fashioned from former classrooms complete with original chalkboards and cloakrooms – others with an author's theme), a restaurant, multiple small bars, a movie theater, soaking pool, gymnasium for live music, cigar bar (the principal's office) and a brewery. Extensive original artwork and historical photographs cover the walls, ceilings, doorways and hallways.\\n\\nAfterward we headed back to Matt's and Ruth's house and the girls played with their 2 dogs and 9 cats. Kira's allergies kicked in (obviously) and we had to rush her home and pump her full of benedryl. Her eyes and nose were running like the Columbia river.\\n\\n![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5325/17498216976_85ac9d5e46_c.jpg)\\n\\nFriday after work the Apparians in Portland put together a small party since I was in town; there were probably about 5 couples that attended. We sat around, talked and snacked before taking a walk down by the lake for some fantastic pictures! Good times seeing old friends and making new ones!\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7769/16881898414_699f689851_c.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday was a day trip to Astoria! We'd heard great things about the city and were excited to take the 2 hour drive to the coast. The city didn't disappoint. They've done a great job making the city tourist friendly but still keeping the rustic charm. Cathy and I didn't realize that the movies \\\"Goonies\\\" was filmed there so we tried to explain the movies to the girls. I made a mental note to download it in the near future. Every kid should watch Goonies.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8754/17316881070_c4e54fa180_c.jpg)\\n\\nSince it was lunch time our first stop was the [Fort George Brewery](http://www.fortgeorgebrewery.com/). It was fantastic!! They have an awesome pizza restaurant upstairs with some great beers. Everyone loved the ambiance, food and beer (ok.. the kids didn't drink any beer). I'd love to go back as it's one of my top 5 favorite breweries so far. Super cool! Afterwards we stopped in a glassblowing shop and watched them for about an hour! Hali and I loved it and we ended up buying a cup and a really cool beer mug. Really nice guys and we ended up learning a lot about the craft.\\n\\n![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5330/17317040688_ddbb3db598_c.jpg)\\n\\nThen we drove to the top of the town and went to [Astoria Column](http://astoriacolumn.org/) to throw paper airplanes. The walk to the top of the tower wasn't bad for Kira and the view of the town, Columbia River and ocean was outstanding!! Apparently the thing to do is buy a paper airplane in the gift shop and see how far you can fly it from the top of the Column. The girls really enjoyed watching everyone throw their planes. Finally we rode the cable car along the water front and then had a *disappointing* dinner at [Bouy Brewery](http://www.bouybeer.com), which everyone had raved about. The best part of the dinner was that they had built the restaurant on the docks and the floors had glass sections so you could look down and watch the sea lions underneath.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7799/16886493664_6b5d478e80_c.jpg)\\n\\nSunday was Mother's Day and Lexi's Birthday! I got up early and took all of the kids to McDonald's for breakfast while Cathy slept. Later on we walked down the street to Burgerville for lunch (Lexi's choice) and then had cake and opened presents. She got bunch of Wal-Mart gift cards, clothes and a new bike! We'd purchased the bike the night before and hide it outside the RV; she loved it and immeditely took it for a spin around the RV park! Cathy and I weren't feeling well so we skipped our planned trip to Mt. Saint Helens and just stayed home playing and watching Goonies.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8830/17506549592_a98cca0dcc_c.jpg)\\n\\nMonday was school and work as usual then we took off for Olympia, two hours north. We were preparing to leave on the ferry for Alaska from north of Seattle and I needed to fly to San Francisco for a couple of days. Everything was taking place new Seattle so it was a hard date we couldn't miss. We would miss Portland.\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653084944335%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653084944335%2F&set_id=72157653084944335&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653084944335%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653084944335%2F&set_id=72157653084944335&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: May 1st - May 11th  \\nRV Park: [Ninety Nine RV Park](http://www.99rvpark.net), Vancouver, WA\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Portland is my kind of town!

Luckily the weather was beautiful the entire 10\ndays we were there so Cathy was partial to it as well. The area is nice, the\ntraffic isn't too bad and there's a lot to do for families. It was a great stop\nfor us. Since Portland is \"Beer Country\" we did a lot of \"beer things\" like\nhitting the local breweries for dinner and hanging out with friends at pubs (I\nhave a bunch of Appirians and ex-Appirians there). I loved Portland and can't\nwait to go back!\n\n\n\nOur two hour drive to the RV park took an extra hour as we hit rush hour traffic\non the south side of Portland. The RV park was actually just north over the\nbidge in Vancouver, WA so it was a looonnnggg journey. Our spot couldn't have\nbeen easier to get into and after quickly setting up we headed to McMenamins on\nthe Columbia [http://www.mcmenamins.com/299-mcmenamins-on-the-columbia-home] \nwhich is a local brewery with awesome outside patio dining. We walked up and\ndown the river until our table was ready and then had a great dinner before\nheading home for bed.\n\n\n\nSaturday was the day that Hali and I had been anticipating for a week or two! We\nwere going to brew our beer! I had ordered an IPA beer kit from the Appirio\ncompany store and we had finally found some pots big enough to actually make\nbeer in the RV. Our first batch would be called \"Jali RV IPA\" ... or \"Jeff and\nHali IPA\" or .. if Hali drinks this beer \"I'll go to Jail-y IPA\". We spent\nalmost the entire morning (3 hours?) brewing beer and learning some science\nalong the way. We made a hot mess of the kitchen (water and beer and stuff all\nover the floor and stove) so Cathy quietly excused herself so she would't have\nto look at the destruction we'd wrought. Hali was my assistant brewmaster and\ndid a great job cooking the wort, watching the pot and adding some hops while I\nran out for a funnel and some ice. After it was done cooling we poured it into\nin the gallon glass jug and stuck it in the closet so the yeast could work it's\nmagic. Hali was so proud of herself and brags to everyone how she knows how to\nmake beer. Best. Morning. Evar!\n\n\n\nAfter we cleaned up the house and ourselves, we took off an hour or so east to \nMultnomah Falls [http://www.oregon.com/attractions/multnomah_falls] as a number\nof people had suggested we not miss it. The falls were awesome but crowded. We\nbathed in their majesty for awhile and then got hot chocolate and snacks before\nloading back into the truck and heading home to relax and play for the\nafternoon.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday we decided to head into Portland to see the city. We got a tip from a\nbuddy to walk down by the river as there was a Cinco de Mayo festival going on\nplus the weekly arts & crafts fair.\tThe walk was quite lovely but we really had\nfun browsing the \"weird\" booths at the arts and crafts fair. I honestly think we\nstopped at every booth. We then walked a block past the fair and had a snack at\nthe Thirsty Bear; sitting on the sidewalk in the sun just watching people.\nAfterwards we noticed a huge line around the corner at Voodoo Donuts\n[http://voodoodoughnut.com]. We'd never heard of it before but apparently it's \nbig on the Food Network. We waited in line for 20 minutes for our pink box of\ndonuts and then ate till we were sick. Later that night we met our friends Matt\nand Ruth at Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House\n[http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/locations/portland] and ended up stay roughly 3\nhours just chatting away and catching up.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the week was more or less work and school as usual. We did find \nWashington Park\n[http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?&propertyid=841&action=viewpark] \none night and let the girls play for awhile to burn off some energy. They were\nsuper funny and the park was beautiful! Matt had invited me to play card later\nin the week so I had Cathy drop me off at another brewery (there 52 in Oregon!!)\nto meet up with Matt, Ruth and some of their friends. I'm not a big card player\nbut it was a lot of fun and I had the opportunity to try some new beer. I marked\nthe night down in the win column.\n\n\n\nThursday night we met over at Matt and Ruth's house and then walked down the\nstreet to the Kennedy School [http://www.mcmenamins.com/427-kennedy-school-home]\n. Apparently the McMenamins brothers buy old property and turn them into\nrestaurants and such. They'd taken a historic elementary school and turned it\ninto something completely awesome!! We absolutely feel in love with the place\nand had a blast!\n\n> Since its 1915 opening, this historic elementary school has been a beloved\nfixture of its Northeast Portland neighborhood. McMenamins renovated the\nonce-abandoned scholastic gem and turned it into Portland's most unique hotel.\nHere you'll find 57 comfy guestrooms with private baths and telephones (some\nfashioned from former classrooms complete with original chalkboards and\ncloakrooms – others with an author's theme), a restaurant, multiple small bars,\na movie theater, soaking pool, gymnasium for live music, cigar bar (the\nprincipal's office) and a brewery. Extensive original artwork and historical\nphotographs cover the walls, ceilings, doorways and hallways.\n\n\nAfterward we headed back to Matt's and Ruth's house and the girls played with\ntheir 2 dogs and 9 cats. Kira's allergies kicked in (obviously) and we had to\nrush her home and pump her full of benedryl. Her eyes and nose were running like\nthe Columbia river.\n\n\n\nFriday after work the Apparians in Portland put together a small party since I\nwas in town; there were probably about 5 couples that attended. We sat around,\ntalked and snacked before taking a walk down by the lake for some fantastic\npictures! Good times seeing old friends and making new ones!\n\n\n\nSaturday was a day trip to Astoria! We'd heard great things about the city and\nwere excited to take the 2 hour drive to the coast. The city didn't disappoint.\nThey've done a great job making the city tourist friendly but still keeping the\nrustic charm. Cathy and I didn't realize that the movies \"Goonies\" was filmed\nthere so we tried to explain the movies to the girls. I made a mental note to\ndownload it in the near future. Every kid should watch Goonies.\n\n\n\nSince it was lunch time our first stop was the Fort George Brewery\n[http://www.fortgeorgebrewery.com/]. It was fantastic!! They have an awesome\npizza restaurant upstairs with some great beers. Everyone loved the ambiance,\nfood and beer (ok.. the kids didn't drink any beer). I'd love to go back as it's\none of my top 5 favorite breweries so far. Super cool! Afterwards we stopped in\na glassblowing shop and watched them for about an hour! Hali and I loved it and\nwe ended up buying a cup and a really cool beer mug. Really nice guys and we\nended up learning a lot about the craft.\n\n\n\nThen we drove to the top of the town and went to Astoria Column\n[http://astoriacolumn.org/] to throw paper airplanes. The walk to the top of the\ntower wasn't bad for Kira and the view of the town, Columbia River and ocean was\noutstanding!! Apparently the thing to do is buy a paper airplane in the gift\nshop and see how far you can fly it from the top of the Column. The girls really\nenjoyed watching everyone throw their planes. Finally we rode the cable car\nalong the water front and then had a disappointing dinner at Bouy Brewery\n[http://www.bouybeer.com], which everyone had raved about. The best part of the\ndinner was that they had built the restaurant on the docks and the floors had\nglass sections so you could look down and watch the sea lions underneath.\n\n\n\nSunday was Mother's Day and Lexi's Birthday! I got up early and took all of the\nkids to McDonald's for breakfast while Cathy slept. Later on we walked down the\nstreet to Burgerville for lunch (Lexi's choice) and then had cake and opened\npresents. She got bunch of Wal-Mart gift cards, clothes and a new bike! We'd\npurchased the bike the night before and hide it outside the RV; she loved it and\nimmeditely took it for a spin around the RV park! Cathy and I weren't feeling\nwell so we skipped our planned trip to Mt. Saint Helens and just stayed home\nplaying and watching Goonies.\n\n\n\nMonday was school and work as usual then we took off for Olympia, two hours\nnorth. We were preparing to leave on the ferry for Alaska from north of Seattle\nand I needed to fly to San Francisco for a couple of days. Everything was taking\nplace new Seattle so it was a hard date we couldn't miss. We would miss\nPortland.\n\n \n\nDates: May 1st - May 11th\nRV Park: Ninety Nine RV Park [http://www.99rvpark.net], Vancouver, WA","feature_image":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7776/17316304658_c5dc6b73ae_c.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-05-29T18:02:48.000Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T20:50:04.000Z","published_at":"2015-05-29T20:50:04.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f31","uuid":"a85c4279-fc09-49e8-9514-474d19c569a0","title":"A Little Playtime in Washington","slug":"olympia-wa","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Olympia was our last stop in the lower 48 before jumping on the ferry for six weeks in Alaska!

I was amazed at the little houses along the way in middle of (literally) nowhere.  The girls passed the time either in our room watching movies and playing games or watching movies in the lounge. There wasn't much for them to do. Cathy and I wandered about looking at the scenery and watching the coastline go buy.

It was the first of many stops that day but the only one with enough time to jump off and stretch our legs. Eventhough it was early, everyone wanted to get off the boat for awhile.  We headed towards town and stopped for breakfast at this hole-in-the-wall restaurant called \\\"Dave's\\\". Afterwards we walked a mile or so down to where the cruise ships come in; this was called \\\"downtown\\\". We spent a hour or so wandering around with the cruise ship tourists before catching a cab back to the ferry. It was a little too \\\"touristy\\\" for us. \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7753/18106902432_468a861246_c.jpg)\\n\\nThat night Cathy and I had \\\"a night out\\\" by ourselves while the kids opted to stay in the room and watch movies. We wandered around the deck (the weather was so \\\"cathy\\\" aka gorgeous) and then had a nice, quiet dinner in the restaurant.  Alone... without chattering twits! Then we came back and watched movies with the girls in the theatre as usual. We tried to hit the sack early as we were getting off the boat in Juneau the next morning at 4:45am!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8862/18083882276_93cb7cb01e_c.jpg)\\n\\nThe morning came early but it's surprisingly light at 5am in Juneau and no one seemed to really care. We were in Alaska finally!! We pulled off the boat with ease and had two choices: left to \\\"End of the Road\\\" in 24 miles or right to Juneau. We chose right and drove 15 miles or so to downtown Juneau to kill some time. We weren't supposed to check into our RV spot till 3pm so we weren't sure what we were going to do while still hooked up. After we rolled past the tourist section of town we noticed that it was getting rather rural. So we looked at the map and noticed that we would shortly be at the end of the road. The only way to access Juneau is by boat and there are no roads that lead in or out. We had literally reached the end of the road. So we finally found a small dirt road and I executed a perfect three point turn (like a boss!) to get us heading back towards town again. I'm glad I put in some time practicing while in Olympia!!\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7745/17939081949_bfe170a03a_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe'd passed a Wal-Mart on the way in from the ferry so we decided to kill some time shopping for necessities. We received some funny stares since it was only 7am but I got everything I needed to be a \\\"native Alaskan\\\". Over the next few days we'd make plenty of trips to Wal-Mart!!\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7726/17489819993_76a09e0acf_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe were done shopping around 8am and were wondering what we'd do now. We were only 5 miles or so from our campground so we decided to take a chance and see if they's let us check in early. This was our first stay at a state park and we weren't quite sure now things worked. The campground itself was gorgeous. It was on the side of Mendenhall Lake which is part of the famous [Mendenhall Glacier](http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/tongass/about-forest/offices/?cid=stelprdb5400800). Fortunately for us there is no check process at the campground. No front desk. No camp office. No anything. You just pull into your spot. If fact, we never ran into anyone that \\\"worked\\\" at the campground at all. It appeared to be totally on the honor system.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7677/18126379491_bfe79e6f45_c.jpg)\\n\\nAfter getting setup we relaxed around the house for a couple of hours just soaking in Alaska. I started whittling Cathy a new kitchen table and made good progress on one of the legs. ;) The weather was absolutely gorgeous: sunny and warm (low 60s?)! The girls played in the woods nearby but we kept a close eye on them reeling them back in if they wandered out too far. There were signs all over about bears and we were paranoid.  They looked like tasty little bear treats.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8841/18083904446_050b6992ea_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe'd been on that boat for three days and wanted to **do** something. So we piled into the truck shortly around 10am and headed back to town to do some sightseeing. We wandered around the shops for awhile and we met a really cute girl, Lani, that owned a massage store. She really like the girls and we talked for quite some time.  Cathy's back had been hurting and she made an appointment (which she soon cancelled) for a massage. We'd run into Lani later.\\n\\nOur first stop was the [Mount Roberts Tramway](http://mountrobertstramway.com/) to the top of the city overlooking downtown. We didn't hike the trails but everyone enjoyed getting a closeup view of the injured bald eagle they've had in captavity for 13 years. It was almost as big as Lexi! Probably the highlight was watching the 15 minute video about the native tribe in the area (Chilkat) and carving totem poles! We had chatted with a guy on the way up in the tram that worked in the gift shop carving this huge totem pole for customers. He was super funny and nice (we hit it off immediately) and everyone took turns carving the totem pole. A lot of fun!!\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7761/18111777001_5f0cba6d6c_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe didn't have plans for the day but I looked at the weather forecast and noticed that it was supposed to rain all day Wednesday; our ziplining day. So I called the company and asked if there was any way to get in that afternoon. We had lunch at the (not so kid friendly) [Red Dog Saloon](http://www.reddogsaloon.com/) before meeting the zipling van at 2:45. Zipling was an absolute blast!! Lexi was a little more hesitant than we anticipated but Kira was all for it. No problem or hesitation whatsoever. She was a zipling champion. Hali of course was a rockstar as always. There are some great videos below so make sure to watch them.\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8868/17485730244_6beb63426a_c.jpg)\\n\\n After ziplining everyone except Kira took a turn trying their hand at axe throwing. I was somewhat relieved she didn't want to participate. The thought of Kira handling, let alone throwing, an axe scares me to death! I was the only one to hit the target (with the sharp side) but Cathy was fun to watch. I missed with my first three throws and then switched to a different axe. I stuck it with my fourth so I blamed the first misses on a bum axe. \\n \\nEveryone at [Alaska Zipline Adventures](http://www.alaskazip.com/) were great but they failed us when it came to dinner recommendations. They sent us to [Hanger Cafe](http://www.thehangarcafe.com/) down on the water which was horrible. Service was terrible and the food was only moderately good. \\n \\n ![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8830/17947769168_ed9a207a31_c.jpg)\\n \\nThe next day we were up early for our whale watching tour at 9am. The tour was really small (us and another couple) so we had a blast hanging up top with the captain for nearly 4 hours. Capt. Alan was an Irishman that had relocated to Juneau 13 years ago and settled down. Extremely knowledgable and friendly. The girls immediately made \\\"besties\\\" with Amy, his 17 yr old deck hand. Amy entertained them for the majority of the cruise after they got bored with the whales. The girls coerced Amy to babysit so we just had to arrange a night we could go out.\\n \\n ![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7689/18137254321_83a68616a2_c.jpg)\\n \\n According to Capt. Alan, it was a great day whale watching. We saw a number of mothers and their calves and one juveline whale \\\"breaching\\\" (jumping out of the water) in the exact spot we were looking! I even encouraged Capt. Alan to name one nameless mother \\\"Kira\\\" since its distinctive tail was all black. It's hard to get good whale pictures but we have some below of whale tales and \\\"slaps\\\". \\n \\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/272/17673605383_3081184a3f_c.jpg)\\n \\n Afterwards we took Capt. Alan's recommendation and went across the bridge to Douglas Island for pizza and beer at [Island Pub](http://www.theislandpub.com/) (apparently his second home). Everyone was full but we still wanted to spend more time outdoors. The girls had spotted an **enormous** playground while driving to and from Juneau so we stopped there so ~~I~~ they could play. They really know how to build playgrounds in Alaska!\\n \\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7754/17673627893_4235850dbd_c.jpg)\\n \\nWe decided to visit Mendenhall Glacier and [Nugget Falls](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g31020-d4071203-Reviews-Nugget_Falls-Juneau_Alaska.html) on our way home; they were literally right next door to the campground. We stopped at the Visitor's Center and walked 30 minutes or so to the Falls so we could get a good view of both. We took some pretty good pictures, stuck our hands in the glacierly cold lake and then headed back home. The girls wanted to sleep in the tent that night so we set it up and put them to bed around 9am. Cathy started thinking about bears eating the girls and decided she wanted to bring them in.\\n \\n Sunday was normal day for us; Hali said we did \\\"nothing\\\" that day. We did laundry, gassed up the truck for the ferry in the morning and ran errands. Amy (the whale watching tour deck hand) was babysitting for us that evening so we were going to have a night out on the town. I had a massage that afternoon with the Lani (who used to work for Capt. Alan's wife also!) and picked up pizza on my way home. Cathy and I headed back to the Island Pub again for dinner and started talking to a guy that sat down next to us at the bar. It turned out that he was a friend of Capt. Alan's and he was meeting him there. A few minutes later Capt. Alan walked in and sat down next to him and we started chatting. Apparently Juneau is a small city!!\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7748/18101275210_f2e4d96cae_c.jpg)\\n \\nAfter dinner we made one last stop at Wal-Mart, headed back home and packed up the RV. Our ferry for Haines left in the morning at 7am which meant we had to be there by 5am. So instead of getting up early, packing up, hitting the dump station and then heading to the ferry, we decided to head over to the ferry and sleep in the parking lot instead. Hopefully it would make the girls easier to handle.\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653086481968%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653086481968%2F&set_id=72157653086481968&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653086481968%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157653086481968%2F&set_id=72157653086481968&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: May 22nd - May 29th  \\nRV Park: [Mendenhall Campground](http://www.recreation.gov/camping/mendenhall-campground/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=75389), Juneau, AK\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Everyone absolutely loved Juneau!

Then we came back and watched movies with the\ngirls in the theatre as usual. We tried to hit the sack early as we were getting\noff the boat in Juneau the next morning at 4:45am!\n\n\n\nThe morning came early but it's surprisingly light at 5am in Juneau and no one\nseemed to really care. We were in Alaska finally!! We pulled off the boat with\nease and had two choices: left to \"End of the Road\" in 24 miles or right to\nJuneau. We chose right and drove 15 miles or so to downtown Juneau to kill some\ntime. We weren't supposed to check into our RV spot till 3pm so we weren't sure\nwhat we were going to do while still hooked up. After we rolled past the tourist\nsection of town we noticed that it was getting rather rural. So we looked at the\nmap and noticed that we would shortly be at the end of the road. The only way to\naccess Juneau is by boat and there are no roads that lead in or out. We had\nliterally reached the end of the road. So we finally found a small dirt road and\nI executed a perfect three point turn (like a boss!) to get us heading back\ntowards town again. I'm glad I put in some time practicing while in Olympia!!\n\n\n\nWe'd passed a Wal-Mart on the way in from the ferry so we decided to kill some\ntime shopping for necessities. We received some funny stares since it was only\n7am but I got everything I needed to be a \"native Alaskan\". Over the next few\ndays we'd make plenty of trips to Wal-Mart!!\n\n\n\nWe were done shopping around 8am and were wondering what we'd do now. We were\nonly 5 miles or so from our campground so we decided to take a chance and see if\nthey's let us check in early. This was our first stay at a state park and we\nweren't quite sure now things worked. The campground itself was gorgeous. It was\non the side of Mendenhall Lake which is part of the famous Mendenhall Glacier\n[http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/tongass/about-forest/offices/?cid=stelprdb5400800]\n. Fortunately for us there is no check process at the campground. No front desk.\nNo camp office. No anything. You just pull into your spot. If fact, we never ran\ninto anyone that \"worked\" at the campground at all. It appeared to be totally on\nthe honor system.\n\n\n\nAfter getting setup we relaxed around the house for a couple of hours just\nsoaking in Alaska. I started whittling Cathy a new kitchen table and made good\nprogress on one of the legs. ;) The weather was absolutely gorgeous: sunny and\nwarm (low 60s?)! The girls played in the woods nearby but we kept a close eye on\nthem reeling them back in if they wandered out too far. There were signs all\nover about bears and we were paranoid. They looked like tasty little bear\ntreats.\n\n\n\nWe'd been on that boat for three days and wanted to do something. So we piled\ninto the truck shortly around 10am and headed back to town to do some\nsightseeing. We wandered around the shops for awhile and we met a really cute\ngirl, Lani, that owned a massage store. She really like the girls and we talked\nfor quite some time. Cathy's back had been hurting and she made an appointment\n(which she soon cancelled) for a massage. We'd run into Lani later.\n\nOur first stop was the Mount Roberts Tramway [http://mountrobertstramway.com/] \nto the top of the city overlooking downtown. We didn't hike the trails but\neveryone enjoyed getting a closeup view of the injured bald eagle they've had in\ncaptavity for 13 years. It was almost as big as Lexi! Probably the highlight was\nwatching the 15 minute video about the native tribe in the area (Chilkat) and\ncarving totem poles! We had chatted with a guy on the way up in the tram that\nworked in the gift shop carving this huge totem pole for customers. He was super\nfunny and nice (we hit it off immediately) and everyone took turns carving the\ntotem pole. A lot of fun!!\n\n\n\nWe didn't have plans for the day but I looked at the weather forecast and\nnoticed that it was supposed to rain all day Wednesday; our ziplining day. So I\ncalled the company and asked if there was any way to get in that afternoon. We\nhad lunch at the (not so kid friendly) Red Dog Saloon\n[http://www.reddogsaloon.com/] before meeting the zipling van at 2:45. Zipling\nwas an absolute blast!! Lexi was a little more hesitant than we anticipated but\nKira was all for it. No problem or hesitation whatsoever. She was a zipling\nchampion. Hali of course was a rockstar as always. There are some great videos\nbelow so make sure to watch them.\n\n\n\nAfter ziplining everyone except Kira took a turn trying their hand at axe\nthrowing. I was somewhat relieved she didn't want to participate. The thought of\nKira handling, let alone throwing, an axe scares me to death! I was the only one\nto hit the target (with the sharp side) but Cathy was fun to watch. I missed\nwith my first three throws and then switched to a different axe. I stuck it with\nmy fourth so I blamed the first misses on a bum axe.\n\nEveryone at Alaska Zipline Adventures [http://www.alaskazip.com/] were great but\nthey failed us when it came to dinner recommendations. They sent us to Hanger\nCafe [http://www.thehangarcafe.com/] down on the water which was horrible.\nService was terrible and the food was only moderately good.\n\n\n\nThe next day we were up early for our whale watching tour at 9am. The tour was\nreally small (us and another couple) so we had a blast hanging up top with the\ncaptain for nearly 4 hours. Capt. Alan was an Irishman that had relocated to\nJuneau 13 years ago and settled down. Extremely knowledgable and friendly. The\ngirls immediately made \"besties\" with Amy, his 17 yr old deck hand. Amy\nentertained them for the majority of the cruise after they got bored with the\nwhales. The girls coerced Amy to babysit so we just had to arrange a night we\ncould go out.\n\n\n\nAccording to Capt. Alan, it was a great day whale watching. We saw a number of\nmothers and their calves and one juveline whale \"breaching\" (jumping out of the\nwater) in the exact spot we were looking! I even encouraged Capt. Alan to name\none nameless mother \"Kira\" since its distinctive tail was all black. It's hard\nto get good whale pictures but we have some below of whale tales and \"slaps\".\n\n\n\nAfterwards we took Capt. Alan's recommendation and went across the bridge to\nDouglas Island for pizza and beer at Island Pub [http://www.theislandpub.com/] \n(apparently his second home). Everyone was full but we still wanted to spend\nmore time outdoors. The girls had spotted an enormous playground while driving\nto and from Juneau so we stopped there so I they could play. They really know\nhow to build playgrounds in Alaska!\n\n\n\nWe decided to visit Mendenhall Glacier and Nugget Falls\n[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g31020-d4071203-Reviews-Nugget_Falls-Juneau_Alaska.html] \non our way home; they were literally right next door to the campground. We\nstopped at the Visitor's Center and walked 30 minutes or so to the Falls so we\ncould get a good view of both. We took some pretty good pictures, stuck our\nhands in the glacierly cold lake and then headed back home. The girls wanted to\nsleep in the tent that night so we set it up and put them to bed around 9am.\nCathy started thinking about bears eating the girls and decided she wanted to\nbring them in.\n\nSunday was normal day for us; Hali said we did \"nothing\" that day. We did\nlaundry, gassed up the truck for the ferry in the morning and ran errands. Amy\n(the whale watching tour deck hand) was babysitting for us that evening so we\nwere going to have a night out on the town. I had a massage that afternoon with\nthe Lani (who used to work for Capt. Alan's wife also!) and picked up pizza on\nmy way home. Cathy and I headed back to the Island Pub again for dinner and\nstarted talking to a guy that sat down next to us at the bar. It turned out that\nhe was a friend of Capt. Alan's and he was meeting him there. A few minutes\nlater Capt. Alan walked in and sat down next to him and we started chatting.\nApparently Juneau is a small city!!\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we made one last stop at Wal-Mart, headed back home and packed up\nthe RV. Our ferry for Haines left in the morning at 7am which meant we had to be\nthere by 5am. So instead of getting up early, packing up, hitting the dump\nstation and then heading to the ferry, we decided to head over to the ferry and\nsleep in the parking lot instead. Hopefully it would make the girls easier to\nhandle.\n\n \n\nDates: May 22nd - May 29th\nRV Park: Mendenhall Campground\n[http://www.recreation.gov/camping/mendenhall-campground/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=75389]\n, Juneau, AK","feature_image":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7797/17673646363_6643e4ebd1_c.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-06-01T16:09:23.000Z","updated_at":"2015-06-01T17:42:23.000Z","published_at":"2015-06-01T17:42:23.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f33","uuid":"89d88738-030a-4e89-9259-e57622125d64","title":"Anchorage or Bust!","slug":"anchorage-ak","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Our Anchorage stop consisted of 3 days **getting** to Anchorage and three days actually **in** Anchorage.

We were taking the ferry from Juneau to Haines so we setup the RV in the parking lot the night before. We woke up at 4:45am as we had to checkin for the ferry at 5am. We got everyone ready, folded up the house and pulled into line about 5:45am. Luckily we were one of the first vehicles to load this time! It was a 4.5 hour trip to Haines and we spent most of the morning in the galley eating breakfast and watching movies until we docked at 11:30am.\\n\\nThe ferry was much smaller than our first one, probably half the size, which made our exit interesting. They wanted us to make 180 degree turn in an area that obviously wouldn't support it. Cathy started to freak out and I literally told her to shut her mouth during the process. However, the guys were pros and after about 15 minutes of maneuvering the RV around they got us out with no problems!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8849/18262595626_e0ed43cae6_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe exited the ferry about 10 miles from Haines and decided to stop for lunch before heading off on our trek. We parked the RV on a hill (which made me nervous the entire afternoon) and started to walk around town looking for things to do. Apparently Haines is a retirement community with about 4 blocks of \\\"downtown\\\" and a handful of shops and restaurants. We had an OK lunch down by the water and then Cathy took the girls to Safeway for travel snacks while I toured the [Hammer Museum](http://www.hammermuseum.org/). The museum was the only reason that I wanted to stop in Haines. I wanted to be able to say that I \\\"got hammered in Haines\\\"!\\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/313/18604990112_ca40991a36_c.jpg)\\n\\nI'd been looking for a new pocket knife since we arrived in Alaska and one of the stores directed just up the hill to the \\\"best knife maker in Alaska\\\". So I stopped into [Alaska Rod's](http://www.alaskarods.com/) on the way back to the truck and bought this awesome knife from his wife as soon as I saw it. He makes all of his knives on site and they are reasonably priced. Now I'm ready to defend my family against bears!\\n\\nWe piled back into the truck and headed towards Anchorage. Google maps said it was a 15 hour trip so we decided to break it up into two (which eventually turned into three) days so we wouldn't kill the girls. After a 45 minute drive through beautiful Alaskan scenery we hit the Canadian border. \\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7789/17666420014_b1a333f560_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe'd spend the rest of the day driving through the beautiful Yukon. It was 79 degrees and sunny with snow capped mountains. Very strange. We appeared to be the only ones heading north and I think we  counted 14 or so cars during the 5-6 hour trip. It seem deserted. We'd heard stories of how bad the \\\"Alaskan Highway\\\" was but the road through the Yukon was pretty nice.... until we hit [Destruction Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Destruction+Bay,+YT,+Canada/@61.2504293,-138.7992879,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x5152b9ffea6418eb:0xa77b3bf3e8e5f183) for gas and food. The official Alaskan Highway\\\" starts just north of Destruction Bay and it was **aweful**; just as bad as stories depicted it. When we weren't driving throughout dusty, bumpy road construction we were trying to avoid patched roads that shook the entire truck and RV. Since the Canadians seemed to be inept at fixing roads (the American side was far better!) they placed flags wherever there was a bad patch of road. They also have what are called \\\"frost heaves\\\" which is when the road freezes and thaws. This causes the road to form ripples or \\\"mountainous bumps\\\" that make you feel like you are riding a roller coaster. It really does a number on the shocks and scares the crap out of you. Fortunately, constantly dodging potholes and scanning for ditches, craters and frost heaves kept me wide awake while driving the Alaskan Highway. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8899/18101305930_955c67cac3_c.jpg)\\n\\nCathy had found a RV park called [Discovery Yukon Lodgings](http://www.discoveryyukon.com/) just shy of the US border in the middle of nowhere (literally) which was billed as \\\"an oasis on the Alaskan Highway\\\". It was. Apparently everyone stops there for the night while traveling the highway. Everyone was super nice and we got a good night's sleep before taking off in the morning. \\n\\nIt was only 30 miles or so to the border and the roads were again a mess. However, they improved considerably as we approached Alaska. The US border guard was really nice but we had to toss our eggs and uncooked chicken from our fridge. Cathy was sad. The Alaskan Highway in the US is **much** better. I'd give the Canadian portion a D- and the US portion a solid B. The road was much smoother and the \\\"bumps\\\" they marked with flags were almost laughable in comparison to Canada's. The flags weren't needed.\\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/437/17671190204_144b9b9e02_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe stopped in a couple of small \\\"towns\\\" along the way for gas whenever we could find it. We took a little more time in [Tok](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tok,+AK/@63.3226495,-143.074947,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x514a7375ee013bc1:0x220333797f4bd4e8) to stretch out legs and wash the highway off the truck and RV. We drove a couple of more hours and  decided to stop in [Glenallen](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Glennallen,+AK/@62.1371669,-145.7133916,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x56b58f7ca3dee581:0xb6ed06eaba74ea88) for the night (3 hours outside of Anchorage). Everyone was done traveling for the day and the weather was beautiful. We found an RV park off the highway and decided to relax for the rest of the day. Unfortunately the mosquitos were everywhere and we couldn't stay outside for longer than a minute or so else you'd pass out from blood loss. This was the first time we'd really encountered any bugs in Alaska.\\n\\n![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7760/18395088531_6b74b70397_c.jpg)\\n\\nThe next morning we got up early and took off for Anchorage. Our plan was to take some time to see the [Matanuska Glacier](http://www.alaska.org/advice/best-roadside-glaciers) but apparently we missed the entrance. However, you can't get that close to it and, honestly, it wasn't that impressive. We finally rolled into Anchorage early in the afternoon and got setup. The RV park was nothing special but it was near town and clean. \\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8803/17770836854_d9bd1e9de0_c.jpg)\\n\\nI checked the weather and apparently this was going to be the last sunny day for a quite awhile so we decided to load up the bikes and head to the [Tony Knowles Coastal Trail](http://anchoragecoastaltrail.com) to do some riding. We stopped downtown and rented a tandem bike for Cathy and Kira before taking off. Kira loved it and peddled quite often while mommy took breaks. [Check out the video](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffdonthemic/17989712454/in/album-72157654252300155/) of her in action!\\n\\n![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8777/17772848293_e7a6de2a99_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe peddled around the city for an hour (also called \\\"getting lost\\\") before finding the [Rustic Goat](http://rusticgoat.com/) for dinner. It was an awesome, trendy, hipster little place with great pizza and local beer. Everyone had a blast! I got the prosciutto and peach pizza and the girls killed a pepperoni! I had one too many beers (that's three for everyone counting) so I was a chatty-cathy with the wait staff.  We biked for another hour or so before dropping off our bikes and doing a little window shopping downtown. \\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/395/17920753904_229926b2da_c.jpg)\\n\\nMonday it rained the entire day so we did indoor stuff. Right after lunch we saw the movie Tomorrowland and then went to the mall and Walmart to kill time before dinner. We were meeting one of Cathy's ex-coworkers that had moved to Anchorage for dinner at the [Midnight Sun Brewery](http://midnightsunbrewing.com/). Breweries are always a hit with the girls and I quite fancy them as well. The food and beer was really good, although I had higher expectations based upon what I had heard from people in Juneau. We ended up closing the place down (at 8:30pm) catching up with Paige and getting more info on Alaska. \\n\\nTuesday was an exciting day! It was Cathy's Birthday plus it was time to pop the cap on our first batch of \\\"Jali RV IPA\\\" beer! \\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/511/18207342119_2b77c5a182_c.jpg)\\n\\nTuesday was Cathy's 29th birthday so it was all about her. Lexi made her breakfast and gave her a coupon for a 90 minute massage!! It rained the entire day so we sat around watching movies and Hali made her now-famous potato soup for lunch. I had an eye appointment that morning but I forgot to get Cathy's card so I had to dash out under the guise of getting ingredients for Hali's soup. Cathy wanted sushi for her birthday so found Jimmy's Sushi for a pretty good meal. Everyone was stuffed when we got back home so we just sat around the house and watched TV.\\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/416/18543479025_815daa7892_c.jpg)\\n\\nBefore we went to bed Hali and I had our first sip of our \\\"Jali RV IPA\\\" beer that we had been brewing for a couple of weeks. Not a bad IPA but a little sweet for me. Check out Hali's reaction to her first sip of beer in this video. It's priceless.\\n\\nHali's meds arrived arrived on Wednesday so we could finally take off for Seward.  We packed up and pulled out around noon in the drizzling rain and made our way south for our next stop.\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157654252300155%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157654252300155%2F&set_id=72157654252300155&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157654252300155%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157654252300155%2F&set_id=72157654252300155&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: May 29th - June 3rd  \\nRV Park: [Golden Nugget RV Park](http://goldennuggetcamperpark.com/), Anchorage, AK\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Our Anchorage stop consisted of 3 days <strong>getting</strong> to Anchorage and three days actually <strong>in</strong> Anchorage.

Everyone was done traveling for the day and the weather was beautiful. We found an RV park off the highway and decided to relax for the rest of the day.

We'd heard from a number of people that the city was \"big\nand dirty\" but we enjoyed it. With a population of 300K, it's a good size city\nwith all comforts of home (malls, chain restaurants, etc.) plus 9 breweries!\nIt's somewhat cramped and in the process of growing up (there are new\nneighborhoods and tall buildings going up everywhere) but it's very bicycle and\nfamily friendly. I could definitely spend more time in Anchorage.\n\n\n\nOur journey to Anchorage started in Juneau. We were taking the ferry from Juneau\nto Haines so we setup the RV in the parking lot the night before. We woke up at\n4:45am as we had to checkin for the ferry at 5am. We got everyone ready, folded\nup the house and pulled into line about 5:45am. Luckily we were one of the first\nvehicles to load this time! It was a 4.5 hour trip to Haines and we spent most\nof the morning in the galley eating breakfast and watching movies until we\ndocked at 11:30am.\n\nThe ferry was much smaller than our first one, probably half the size, which\nmade our exit interesting. They wanted us to make 180 degree turn in an area\nthat obviously wouldn't support it. Cathy started to freak out and I literally\ntold her to shut her mouth during the process. However, the guys were pros and\nafter about 15 minutes of maneuvering the RV around they got us out with no\nproblems!\n\n\n\nWe exited the ferry about 10 miles from Haines and decided to stop for lunch\nbefore heading off on our trek. We parked the RV on a hill (which made me\nnervous the entire afternoon) and started to walk around town looking for things\nto do. Apparently Haines is a retirement community with about 4 blocks of\n\"downtown\" and a handful of shops and restaurants. We had an OK lunch down by\nthe water and then Cathy took the girls to Safeway for travel snacks while I\ntoured the Hammer Museum [http://www.hammermuseum.org/]. The museum was the only\nreason that I wanted to stop in Haines. I wanted to be able to say that I \"got\nhammered in Haines\"!\n\n\n\nI'd been looking for a new pocket knife since we arrived in Alaska and one of\nthe stores directed just up the hill to the \"best knife maker in Alaska\". So I\nstopped into Alaska Rod's [http://www.alaskarods.com/] on the way back to the\ntruck and bought this awesome knife from his wife as soon as I saw it. He makes\nall of his knives on site and they are reasonably priced. Now I'm ready to\ndefend my family against bears!\n\nWe piled back into the truck and headed towards Anchorage. Google maps said it\nwas a 15 hour trip so we decided to break it up into two (which eventually\nturned into three) days so we wouldn't kill the girls. After a 45 minute drive\nthrough beautiful Alaskan scenery we hit the Canadian border.\n\n\n\nWe'd spend the rest of the day driving through the beautiful Yukon. It was 79\ndegrees and sunny with snow capped mountains. Very strange. We appeared to be\nthe only ones heading north and I think we counted 14 or so cars during the 5-6\nhour trip. It seem deserted. We'd heard stories of how bad the \"Alaskan Highway\"\nwas but the road through the Yukon was pretty nice.... until we hit Destruction\nBay\n[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Destruction+Bay,+YT,+Canada/@61.2504293,-138.7992879,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x5152b9ffea6418eb:0xa77b3bf3e8e5f183] \nfor gas and food. The official Alaskan Highway\" starts just north of Destruction\nBay and it was aweful; just as bad as stories depicted it. When we weren't\ndriving throughout dusty, bumpy road construction we were trying to avoid\npatched roads that shook the entire truck and RV. Since the Canadians seemed to\nbe inept at fixing roads (the American side was far better!) they placed flags\nwherever there was a bad patch of road. They also have what are called \"frost\nheaves\" which is when the road freezes and thaws. This causes the road to form\nripples or \"mountainous bumps\" that make you feel like you are riding a roller\ncoaster. It really does a number on the shocks and scares the crap out of you.\nFortunately, constantly dodging potholes and scanning for ditches, craters and\nfrost heaves kept me wide awake while driving the Alaskan Highway.\n\n\n\nCathy had found a RV park called Discovery Yukon Lodgings\n[http://www.discoveryyukon.com/] just shy of the US border in the middle of\nnowhere (literally) which was billed as \"an oasis on the Alaskan Highway\". It\nwas. Apparently everyone stops there for the night while traveling the highway.\nEveryone was super nice and we got a good night's sleep before taking off in the\nmorning.\n\nIt was only 30 miles or so to the border and the roads were again a mess.\nHowever, they improved considerably as we approached Alaska. The US border guard\nwas really nice but we had to toss our eggs and uncooked chicken from our\nfridge. Cathy was sad. The Alaskan Highway in the US is much better. I'd give\nthe Canadian portion a D- and the US portion a solid B. The road was much\nsmoother and the \"bumps\" they marked with flags were almost laughable in\ncomparison to Canada's. The flags weren't needed.\n\n\n\nWe stopped in a couple of small \"towns\" along the way for gas whenever we could\nfind it. We took a little more time in Tok\n[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tok,+AK/@63.3226495,-143.074947,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x514a7375ee013bc1:0x220333797f4bd4e8] \nto stretch out legs and wash the highway off the truck and RV. We drove a couple\nof more hours and decided to stop in Glenallen\n[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Glennallen,+AK/@62.1371669,-145.7133916,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x56b58f7ca3dee581:0xb6ed06eaba74ea88] \nfor the night (3 hours outside of Anchorage).

About an hour out of Seward we came around a corner and the oncoming car was flashing its lights. Being from Kentucky, Cathy immediately thought there was a speed trap ahead.  Apparently in Alaska when an oncoming car is blinking its light it means that there is moose nearby and not police. Unfortunately Cathy was too busy screaming \\\"moose\\\" and pointing for the girls that she couldn't get her camera out in time before the moose and her calf leisurely hopped the guardrail and disappeared into the forest.

As we drove through town Cathy had a little bit of RV park envy when we passed the multitude of RVs parked along the water in the city park. Cathy immediately regretted her decision to pay for 4 nights in the middle of nowhere. \\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/403/18505882656_7ebc8b0cbe_c.jpg)\\n\\nWhen we spotted the [Seward Brewing Company](http://www.sewardbrewery.com) the two bookends immediately voted to go there while Cathy and Kira wanted pizza. I cast the deciding vote (which was never in doubt) and we had a lovely dinner at the brewery (it looked like the \\\"finest\\\" restaurant in town). The food and beer was really good and the decor was really cool! Lexi had the $4 root beer and the $14 salmon kid's salad which I gladly finished off when she decided she only wanted the lettuce. \\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/342/17909153014_ae2630d7c8_c.jpg)\\n\\nThursday Cathy was deathly ill but she trudged on like a trooper. Since it was still yucky outside we skipped hiking at Exit Glacier and took everyone to the [Alaska Sealife Center](http://www.alaskasealife.org/) instead to see the seals, sea lions, birds, otters and other fish. We stayed a little over an hour as Cathy started to die in one of the chairs. We took her back home and tried to put her to bed but she slept in one of the chairs instead. For dinner I drove back into Seward and picked up a pizza from Eureka Pizza. Cathy was well enough by that time to at least eat some crust.\\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/490/18527459102_58fe92d3b5_c.jpg)\\n\\nFriday was another crappy, rainy, cloudy day. We had a helicopter/dog sledding tour booked for that afternoon but I called and postponed it. The weather was just too crappy even though the tour was still on. We would rebook it later when the weather was nice.\\n\\nWe met our neighbors when their little dog ran into our RV and they asked if we were going on the Kenai Fjords Tour. We hadn't planned on it but it got us thinking. Instead of staying in the RV in the rain, why not just take the 6.5 hour boat tour (in the rain) to see the glaciers. So with a little stress on Cathy's part we got everyone ready and headed down to the docks and boarded the boat at 11:30am. It was a brand new catamaran with a capacity of a couple of hundred people and they even had lunch and beer on board! \\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/284/18544711971_fd06699dbb_c.jpg)\\n\\nWe spent most of the time looking at sealife in the Fjords on the way out to the glacier but there was one 45 minute stint out in the ocean with 10 foot swells that was not fun. A number of people became sick including Lexi. She puked twice (once in her lap and once in a bag) and was not a happy camper. I did a pretty good job standing up with Hali and keeping her focused on the horizon and keeping her mind on things other than her stomach. Kira was a champ and nothing affected her! She just kept on playing with her toys like nothing special was going on. Perhaps having an absence of balance makes her impervious to rocking boats. I think she needs to be a pirate when she grows up.\\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/475/18488385716_037abbd1e9_c.jpg)\\n\\nNeedless to day, the Aluite Glacier was amazing!! The boat stayed about 100 years from the glacier for 30 minutes or so as we stared in amazement and listened to the sound of calving ice. [This is my favorite video.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffdonthemic/18683907091/in/album-72157654292468936/) They even scooped up a few basketball sized chunks of ice for us to hold and me to taste! This was definitely the highlight of our trip to Seward. \\n\\nWe took a different route back to port and spent less time in the open water but it was more intense. Fortunately Lexi was find this time. We saw some humpback whales (not as good as our whale tour) and did run into a pod of Orcas with 3 adult whales and one baby. Afterwards we simply headed home to eat dinner, watch movies and fully recover from the boat trip.\\n\\n![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/350/17922761664_c0e580ae74_c.jpg)\\n\\nSaturday was our last day in Seward and we wanted to do something outdoors. It was still cloudy but luckily only sprinkled occasionally throughout the day. We decided to grab our rain jackets again and take the short trip to [Exit Glacier](http://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/exit-glacier-area.htm). The is one of the few glaciers that you can actually walk to and really see it up close. It was only a mile walk to the glacier so the girls didn't put up too much of a fight. Hali and Lexi checked out the Junior Ranger kit at the ranger station so they were on a mission to get their badges. The glacier was really cool and we took some awesome photos along the way!\\n\\nThe next morning we packed up and headed to the other side of the peninsula to Soldotna & Kenai!\\n\\n<object width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"> <param name=\\\"flashvars\\\" value=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157654292468936%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157654292468936%2F&set_id=72157654292468936&jump_to=\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\"></param> <param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><embed type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" src=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=1811922554\\\" allowFullScreen=\\\"true\\\" flashvars=\\\"offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157654292468936%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjeffdonthemic%2Fsets%2F72157654292468936%2F&set_id=72157654292468936&jump_to=\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"></embed></object>\\n\\nDates: June 3rd - June 7th  \\nRV Park: [Stoney Creek RV Park](http://www.stoneycreekrvpark.com), Seward, AK\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We knew the awesome weather in Alaska wouldn't last forever.

Lexi had the $4 root beer and the $14 salmon kid's salad which I gladly finished off when she decided she only wanted the lettuce.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/342/17909153014_ae2630d7c8_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Thursday Cathy was deathly ill but she trudged on like a trooper.

We stayed a little over an hour as Cathy started to die in one of the chairs. We took her back home and tried to put her to bed but she slept in one of the chairs instead. For dinner I drove back into Seward and picked up a pizza from Eureka Pizza.

It was cloudy and\nrainy for most of our stay in Seward but we didn't let that get us down. We\nstill managed to do some hiking and visit some glaciers but postponed our\ndogsled tour due to rain.\n\n\n\nWe took off for our short 2.5 hour drive from Anchorage to Seward in a steady\nrain. About an hour out of Seward we came around a corner and the oncoming car\nwas flashing its lights. Being from Kentucky, Cathy immediately thought there\nwas a speed trap ahead. Apparently in Alaska when an oncoming car is blinking\nits light it means that there is moose nearby and not police. Unfortunately\nCathy was too busy screaming \"moose\" and pointing for the girls that she\ncouldn't get her camera out in time before the moose and her calf leisurely\nhopped the guardrail and disappeared into the forest. We placed a $1 bounty on\nthe next moose spotted by the girls.\n\nWe finally found the RV park after our GPS took us astray and we turned around a\ncouple of times. It was quite a ways off the beaten path (the main road/highway)\nbut it was big and clean with a great view of the mountains. It was nearly\ndinnertime so after we got setup we headed into Seward to check out the town and\ngrab a bite to eat. As we drove through town Cathy had a little bit of RV park\nenvy when we passed the multitude of RVs parked along the water in the city\npark. Cathy immediately regretted her decision to pay for 4 nights in the middle\nof nowhere.\n\n\n\nWhen we spotted the Seward Brewing Company [http://www.sewardbrewery.com] the\ntwo bookends immediately voted to go there while Cathy and Kira wanted pizza. I\ncast the deciding vote (which was never in doubt) and we had a lovely dinner at\nthe brewery (it looked like the \"finest\" restaurant in town).

We've hit 30 states so far and even though we have a few more gray hairs and a few extra pounds, everyone is happy, healthy and having a great time.  Looking back here are some recollections of our trip so far. \\n\\n**There's too much to see and do in America.** \\n\\nOur original plan was to allot 2 weeks to visit each state. However, we knew we'd spend more time in states like MA, AK and CA and less time in places like OK, DE and VT. Initially we felt the urge to see everything we could in the places we visited and felt guilty if we stayed home for a day or two. There was so much to see and do. Just as we'd leave somewhere, someone would ask us, \\\"OH!! Did you go see such-n-such place? It's amazing!!\\\" However, we were just doing too much and it started to wear us down. There have been many occasions that they girls have begged us (literally) to stay home. We've started to take days off where we just do nothing but stay at the house and let the girls play.\\n\\n**Good little sardines**\\n\\nEveryone has gotten along great given the fact we've been together 24-7 for the past 12 months in a 41' RV. It's a little cramped sometimes but for the most part we're calm, patient and understanding when personal space is violated. You'd expect a certain amount of arguing and bickering between 3 little girls but for 99% of the time they've been fantastic. No knock-down ,drag out fights or screaming matches with \\\"I hate you\\\" at all. They've been good as gold and it's been amazing how close they've become. Now, the \\\"conversations\\\" between Cathy and Hali are a different story. She recently turned 13.\\n\\n**Hali's health is good**\\n\\nOne of our major concerns with this trip was keeping Hali healthy. For the most part Cathy has been quite successful. She's had a few small issues getting meds shipped to the right location at the right time but she's managed it like a boss. We've flown Hali back to St. Pete three time to see the CF clinic and she has an appointment at the CF clinic in Anchorage next week. Whenever something more serious than a simple cough pops up, Cathy is on the phone with the CF team getting more meds or instructions. The CF team in St. Pete has bent over backwards to help us and we couldn't have kept her healthy without their assistance.\\n\\n**Eating is easy, exercising is hard**\\n\\nOK, we've gained a few pounds along the way; roughly 1/2 lb. per state to be precise. We typically explore the local city after work and school and that usually involves dinner. We often look at photos from early on in our trip and wonder who those skinny, good looking people are with our kids. We've tried to exercise along the way with some success but sometimes the weather or location doesn't cooperate. I brought my tri-bike with us thinking I'd get some rides in but sent it home while in MA. We're typically in a location for 4-7 days and it's hard to find places to run let alone ride.  We may be out in the forest with no roads or in the city with no sidewalks or shoulders to run on. On a number of stays we've just run around inside the RV park. Cathy and I have made a pact to run more... but it's always \\\"tomorrow\\\".\\n\\n**Homeschooling**\\n\\nHomeschooling was new to us and Cathy was somewhat anxious on how it would go. We started out in Cape Cod using K12 and hated it! After a couple of weeks of daily crying, fighting and drinking we switched to Time4Learning and things have been much better. The girls were all successful and excelling with their school year and everyone is quite happy with the results! Some of the girls need more one-on-one attention and home schooling allowed Cathy the opportunity to help out in those certain areas. Learning has become a 24-7 experience as we weave learning concepts into everything we do.\\n\\n**Working in the cloud**\\n\\nWork has been going as well as I expected with no issues. The girls and I need internet for school and work so we typically don't camp far from civilization. With Verizon I almost always 4G connectivity so it's really no different than working at home. I work on east coast time no matter where we are so as we've moved west it's become convenient since I'm an early riser. I'll start at 5am (8am EST) and finish around 3pm PST if there's nothing going on later in the day. However, there's been plenty of days where I've worked till 5/6pm PST  (12 hours) without even realizing it. \\n\\n**Favorite Activities** \\n\\nOur path across the country hugs the coasts and gravitates towards mountains. We've done a lot of hiking and Kira has become more confident along the way. The two bookends are pretty good about hiking and climbing but would rather be on Youtube watching Minecraft or fairy videos.\\n\\nBiking has been another favorite activity but we haven't done it as much as we'd like. We found some great trails in Falmouth, MA and Anchorage, AK and had an absolute blast. Probably some of the best parts of our trips. Lexi learned to ride in Plymouth, MA and we can't keep her off her bike. We bought a tag-along bike in MA that hooked to Cathy's bike for Kira but it was too small and she didn't like it. Kira did much better on the tandem bike we rented in AK.\\n\\nCathy has been dragging everyone to cave tours around the country. Mammoth Cave in KY was awesome (of course) but the rest just seemed OK to me. The girls seem to like them but I'm about done with them. \\n\\nIt's no secret that we (I) like visiting breweries. It started in Maine and has been a continuing trend across the country. I think we've hit almost 40 so far. Besides the good beer, breweries seem to have great food so they are a win for everyone. However, I went a little overboard in OR and Cathy had to implement a temporary embargo. \\n\\n**Bigger is better**\\n\\nSan Diego was a life-changing stop for us. We started our journey in a little 31' Class C and realized about 6 months into the trip that we needed something bigger with a bedroom for the girls. I think it was somewhere around TX we got the itch for a new, humongous fifth wheel RV. We got close to buying a new one a couple of times but everything finally clicked in San Diego and [we found the perfect the one for us](__GHOST_URL__/2015/03/09/movin-on-up/). From that point on it seemed more like *living* and less like *traveling*.\\n\\n**Favorite Attractions / Places**\\n\\n* Niagara Falls - The falls are on the top of everyone's list for favorite attractions. They were amazing!\\n* Graceland - We were surprised by how much the kids loved Graceland. They became Elvis fanatics!\\n* Downtown Nashville - We had a blast at all the restaurants, breweries and dance halls in Nashville. The Country Western Museum was a huge hit as well.\\n* Las Vegas - We didn't think the kids would like Vegas as much as they did but we did a ton of fun stuff. Each night we were on the strip either watching magic shows, Cirque du Soleil (Beatles) or looking at fountains. They had a blast and want to go back.\\n* Theme Parks - Once in awhile we'd find a theme park to give the girls a break from traveling and seeing sights. We did Kings Dominion (VA), Lake Compounce (CT) and Sea World (CA), Disneyland (CA), and Universal Studios (CA).\\n* Tours - We did a number of trolley and duck boat tours in various cities (Boston, Philly, DC, etc.) and Lexi always seemed to fall asleep on them. \\n* Animals - We encountered a number of parks and activities with baby animals. We pet baby cheetahs in CA, baby bears in OR, a baby llama in AK and almost got eaten by an ostrich in a drive-thru safari (TX). The girls want a pet so we got them each \\\"pet rocks\\\" in OR. That didn't go over well with Kira.\\n\\n**Biggest Fails**\\n\\nLike everything else in life, things go wrong and we've had our share. The first month on the road I dumped a cup of coffee on a power strip and shorted out our entire RV.  We haven't had the best luck with our new RV and truck. Within 6 hours of getting the new truck Kira opened her door into a boat trailer and put a small dent in it. Then our first time unhooking the fifth wheel we dropped it onto the tailgate of the truck. A month or two later Cathy \\\"barely tapped\\\" the kingpin plate on the RV with the truck to the point that we couldn't open the tailgate. Good times!\\n\\nWe've also had a couple of trips that were total disappointments. The girls were really excited to visit Disneyland in CA but it was a slightly disappointing. The park is tiny, the lines are long (no guest assistance passes!) and the rides are lame. We were excited about Fantasmic but it was nothing like Disney World. The show was along the river with no seating. We had to put the kids on our shoulders in order for them to see. Definitely not a good experience and we won't be going back.\\n\\nUnfortunately our [Grand Canyon day trip](__GHOST_URL__/2015/04/29/flagstaff-az-grand-canyou/) was a bust as well. We took a 4 hour train ride to the Grand Canyon during the first major snow storm of the season. It was a total whiteout and we were not able to see any part of the Grand Canyon. However, we had made plans to visit again next summer as Lexi wasn't tall enough to take the donkey ride to the bottom.\\n\\n**Favorite States**\\n\\n* MA - We spent 6 weeks in [Massachusetts](__GHOST_URL__/tag/massachusetts/) and fell in love with the state. We ended up staying a month on Cape Code alone. Falmouth is arguably our favorite city so far.\\n* NH - We were pleasantly surprised with [New Hampshire](__GHOST_URL__/tag/new-hampshire/) and can't wait to go back. The state was beautiful and the people were very friendly. We may do a summer sometime in the ME-NH-VT area.\\n* CA - [California](__GHOST_URL__/tag/california/) was by far my favorite state. I'd move there if Cathy would join me. We particularly loved the Sequoia and Giant Redwood trees and national parks. We fell in love with northern CA and the central coast (San Luis Obispo / Monterey). However, Cathy is **definitely not a fan** of San Francisco.\\n* OR - [Oregon](__GHOST_URL__/tag/oregon/) was a beautiful state and we loved the coast. It was a little cool and windy for us but we had a great time. I loved the atmosphere in Portland and the beer culture. We were there for an entire week and the weather was beautiful! Highly unusual, we hear.\\n* AK - [Alaska](__GHOST_URL__/tag/alaska/) is ... well... Alaska and it's incredible. We are still wrapping up the state and I'm trying to convince Cathy to move here. I even promised her that we could start fostering again! \\n* VA - [Virginia](__GHOST_URL__/2014/07/16/colonial-williamsburg-rollercoasters/) is just a gorgeous state! We have a ton of photos just of the country side. We spent the majority of our time doing historical stuff and would love to go back.\\n\\n**Favorite Cities**\\n\\nCathy and I compiled a list our favorite cities and they all coincided with great weather in that area. It may not be fair but the weather at the time of our visit impacts our feelings for the area. \\n\\n* [Charleston, SC](__GHOST_URL__/2014/06/24/charleston-sc/) - Great food, history galore and just a beautiful city. I could eat chicken and waffles every day.\\n* [New Orleans](__GHOST_URL__/2015/01/23/crockpot-turkey-in-the-big-easy/) - We stayed in a crappy RV park just outside of town but everyone had an absolute blast. The girls loved beignets and are asking to go back.\\n* [NYC](__GHOST_URL__/2014/08/13/we-love-the-big-apple/) - Everyone had fun in the Big Apple however I think Kira and I are more fond of the city. She and I have talked about moving there someday. Cathy says she'll miss me.\\n* [Ft Worth, TX](__GHOST_URL__/2015/03/22/ft-worth-tx/) - We stayed downtown in the historic rodeo district and did all sorts of cowboy-things. We had a number of friends and family drop in so it was super fun!\\n* [San Antonio, TX](__GHOST_URL__/2015/02/09/san-antonio-tx/) - Cathy has always told me how awesome San Antonio is and she was absolutely correct. We spent almost the entire stay down at the Riverwalk. I could live in San Antonio!\\n* [San Louis Obispo, CA](__GHOST_URL__/2015/05/15/san-luis-obispo-ca/) - The central coast of CA is one of my favorite spots. Nestled between the ocean and the mountains, it doesn't get much better!\\n* [Falmouth, MA](__GHOST_URL__/2014/10/05/cape-code-it-was-the-best-of-times-it-was-the-worst-of-times/) - We stayed in Falmouth twice cause it was so awesome! There's a reason why the Cape is so popular.\\n* [Washington, DC](__GHOST_URL__/2014/07/10/washington-dc-is-totes-awesome/) - One word: history. Two words: super awesome.\\n* [Sedona, AZ](__GHOST_URL__/2015/04/27/sedona-az/) - Cathy loved Sedona so much that we ended up buying a timeshare there. We'll be back next summer.\\n* [Bar Harbor, ME](__GHOST_URL__/2014/11/07/holy-crap-maine-is-awesome/) - Definitely a future summer spot. Plus, they have a restaurant called \\\"Mainely Meats\\\" that the girls want to eat at again.\\n* [Juneau, AK](__GHOST_URL__/2015/06/01/juneau-ak/) - The weather was perfect in Juneau and we did a ton of great things. One of our favorite stops.\\n* [Portland, OR](__GHOST_URL__/2015/05/29/portland-or/) - I could easily live in Portland. It's a weird city with a great beer and tech culture. Like a smaller San Francisco but with the same percentage of homeless.\\n\\nWe polled the girls and these are their favorite cities:\\n\\n* Lexi - Niagara Falls, Plymouth, NYC & Boston\\n* Kira - NYC, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Graceland & Niagara Falls\\n* Hali - Falmouth, Niagara Falls, Las Vegas, San Antonio, Boston (we went to a Red Sox game) & Kenai, AK\\n\\n**Least Favorite States**\\n\\n* NJ - I think the jokes about NJ are accurate. Not a fan at all of the state.\\n* TX - We had good times in San Antonio and Ft. Worth but the rest of the state was disappointing and exhausting to drive . \\n* VT - It really isn't fair to put Vermont on this list as we were only in the state for one day and it rained the entire time. Perhaps when we head back to Maine sometime we'll give it another shot. Stay classy Vermont!\\n\\n**Least Favorite Cities**\\n\\n* Austin - Everyone talks about how awesome Austin is but I thought it was a dump with terrible traffic; worse than LA. I guess if you are single this would be a great place to hang out. Not family friendly.\\n* San Francisco - I'm a big fan of SF but Cathy has never liked it. She's hated the weather and traffic since the first time she visited. She begrudgingly tolerates it.\\n* Roswell - I was expecting an awesome \\\"alien adventure\\\" in Roswell but it was far from that. A boring, depressing little town. \\n\\n**Random Observations**\\n\\n* People are super nice all around the country especially in Arkansas.\\n* We found great sushi in Louisiana.\\n* Delaware consists mainly of corn fields. Everywhere. Very rural and boring.\\n* Rhode Island is a beautiful little state. We really liked Providence.\\n* I did not dislike Los Angeles as much as I anticipated.\\n* Yosemite National Park was too crowded for us... but fantastic.\\n* They build crazy awesome playgrounds in Alaska.\\n* Don't always trust the GPS.\\n* We could get super fat living in Charleston, SC.\\n* 95% of RV parks are right next to railroad tracks (not a real statistical fact).\\n* Picnics are awesome in the Giant Redwood forest.\\n* Sasquatch are hard to find.\\n* Flip phones still reign supreme in Alaska.  \\n* The Canadian portion of the Alaskan Highway is just as bad as they say it is.\\n* With my beard I'm easily mistaken as an Alaskan. Honestly.\\n* I'll be an awesome long haul truck driver if this software thing doesn't work out for me.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Today we are in Kenai, AK celebrating our one year anniversary on this crazy trip across America.

Initially we felt the urge to see everything we could in the places we visited and felt guilty if we stayed home for a day or two. There was so much to see and do. Just as we'd leave somewhere, someone would ask us, &quot;OH!! Did you go see such-n-such place? It's amazing!!&quot; However, we were just doing too much and it started to wear us down. There have been many occasions that they girls have begged us (literally) to stay home. We've started to take days off where we just do nothing but stay at the house and let the girls play.</p>\n<p><strong>Good little sardines</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone has gotten along great given the fact we've been together 24-7 for the past 12 months in a 41' RV. It's a little cramped sometimes but for the most part we're calm, patient and understanding when personal space is violated. You'd expect a certain amount of arguing and bickering between 3 little girls but for 99% of the time they've been fantastic. No knock-down ,drag out fights or screaming matches with &quot;I hate you&quot; at all. They've been good as gold and it's been amazing how close they've become. Now, the &quot;conversations&quot; between Cathy and Hali are a different story. She recently turned 13.</p>\n<p><strong>Hali's health is good</strong></p>\n<p>One of our major concerns with this trip was keeping Hali healthy. For the most part Cathy has been quite successful. She's had a few small issues getting meds shipped to the right location at the right time but she's managed it like a boss. We've flown Hali back to St. Pete three time to see the CF clinic and she has an appointment at the CF clinic in Anchorage next week. Whenever something more serious than a simple cough pops up, Cathy is on the phone with the CF team getting more meds or instructions. The CF team in St. Pete has bent over backwards to help us and we couldn't have kept her healthy without their assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Eating is easy, exercising is hard</strong></p>\n<p>OK, we've gained a few pounds along the way; roughly 1/2 lb. per state to be precise. We typically explore the local city after work and school and that usually involves dinner. We often look at photos from early on in our trip and wonder who those skinny, good looking people are with our kids. We've tried to exercise along the way with some success but sometimes the weather or location doesn't cooperate. I brought my tri-bike with us thinking I'd get some rides in but sent it home while in MA. We're typically in a location for 4-7 days and it's hard to find places to run let alone ride.  We may be out in the forest with no roads or in the city with no sidewalks or shoulders to run on. On a number of stays we've just run around inside the RV park. Cathy and I have made a pact to run more... but it's always &quot;tomorrow&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Homeschooling</strong></p>\n<p>Homeschooling was new to us and Cathy was somewhat anxious on how it would go. We started out in Cape Cod using K12 and hated it! After a couple of weeks of daily crying, fighting and drinking we switched to Time4Learning and things have been much better. The girls were all successful and excelling with their school year and everyone is quite happy with the results! Some of the girls need more one-on-one attention and home schooling allowed Cathy the opportunity to help out in those certain areas. Learning has become a 24-7 experience as we weave learning concepts into everything we do.</p>\n<p><strong>Working in the cloud</strong></p>\n<p>Work has been going as well as I expected with no issues. The girls and I need internet for school and work so we typically don't camp far from civilization. With Verizon I almost always 4G connectivity so it's really no different than working at home. I work on east coast time no matter where we are so as we've moved west it's become convenient since I'm an early riser. I'll start at 5am (8am EST) and finish around 3pm PST if there's nothing going on later in the day. However, there's been plenty of days where I've worked till 5/6pm PST  (12 hours) without even realizing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorite Activities</strong></p>\n<p>Our path across the country hugs the coasts and gravitates towards mountains. We've done a lot of hiking and Kira has become more confident along the way. The two bookends are pretty good about hiking and climbing but would rather be on Youtube watching Minecraft or fairy videos.</p>\n<p>Biking has been another favorite activity but we haven't done it as much as we'd like. We found some great trails in Falmouth, MA and Anchorage, AK and had an absolute blast. Probably some of the best parts of our trips. Lexi learned to ride in Plymouth, MA and we can't keep her off her bike. We bought a tag-along bike in MA that hooked to Cathy's bike for Kira but it was too small and she didn't like it. Kira did much better on the tandem bike we rented in AK.</p>\n<p>Cathy has been dragging everyone to cave tours around the country. Mammoth Cave in KY was awesome (of course) but the rest just seemed OK to me. The girls seem to like them but I'm about done with them.</p>\n<p>It's no secret that we (I) like visiting breweries. It started in Maine and has been a continuing trend across the country. I think we've hit almost 40 so far. Besides the good beer, breweries seem to have great food so they are a win for everyone. However, I went a little overboard in OR and Cathy had to implement a temporary embargo.</p>\n<p><strong>Bigger is better</strong></p>\n<p>San Diego was a life-changing stop for us. We started our journey in a little 31' Class C and realized about 6 months into the trip that we needed something bigger with a bedroom for the girls. I think it was somewhere around TX we got the itch for a new, humongous fifth wheel RV. We got close to buying a new one a couple of times but everything finally clicked in San Diego and <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/03/09/movin-on-up/\">we found the perfect the one for us</a>. From that point on it seemed more like <em>living</em> and less like <em>traveling</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorite Attractions / Places</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Niagara Falls - The falls are on the top of everyone's list for favorite attractions. They were amazing!</li>\n<li>Graceland - We were surprised by how much the kids loved Graceland. They became Elvis fanatics!</li>\n<li>Downtown Nashville - We had a blast at all the restaurants, breweries and dance halls in Nashville. The Country Western Museum was a huge hit as well.</li>\n<li>Las Vegas - We didn't think the kids would like Vegas as much as they did but we did a ton of fun stuff. Each night we were on the strip either watching magic shows, Cirque du Soleil (Beatles) or looking at fountains. They had a blast and want to go back.</li>\n<li>Theme Parks - Once in awhile we'd find a theme park to give the girls a break from traveling and seeing sights. We did Kings Dominion (VA), Lake Compounce (CT) and Sea World (CA), Disneyland (CA), and Universal Studios (CA).</li>\n<li>Tours - We did a number of trolley and duck boat tours in various cities (Boston, Philly, DC, etc.) and Lexi always seemed to fall asleep on them.</li>\n<li>Animals - We encountered a number of parks and activities with baby animals. We pet baby cheetahs in CA, baby bears in OR, a baby llama in AK and almost got eaten by an ostrich in a drive-thru safari (TX). The girls want a pet so we got them each &quot;pet rocks&quot; in OR. That didn't go over well with Kira.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Biggest Fails</strong></p>\n<p>Like everything else in life, things go wrong and we've had our share. The first month on the road I dumped a cup of coffee on a power strip and shorted out our entire RV.  We haven't had the best luck with our new RV and truck. Within 6 hours of getting the new truck Kira opened her door into a boat trailer and put a small dent in it. Then our first time unhooking the fifth wheel we dropped it onto the tailgate of the truck. A month or two later Cathy &quot;barely tapped&quot; the kingpin plate on the RV with the truck to the point that we couldn't open the tailgate. Good times!</p>\n<p>We've also had a couple of trips that were total disappointments. The girls were really excited to visit Disneyland in CA but it was a slightly disappointing. The park is tiny, the lines are long (no guest assistance passes!) and the rides are lame. We were excited about Fantasmic but it was nothing like Disney World. The show was along the river with no seating. We had to put the kids on our shoulders in order for them to see. Definitely not a good experience and we won't be going back.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately our <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/04/29/flagstaff-az-grand-canyou/\">Grand Canyon day trip</a> was a bust as well. We took a 4 hour train ride to the Grand Canyon during the first major snow storm of the season. It was a total whiteout and we were not able to see any part of the Grand Canyon. However, we had made plans to visit again next summer as Lexi wasn't tall enough to take the donkey ride to the bottom.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorite States</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MA - We spent 6 weeks in <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/massachusetts/\">Massachusetts</a> and fell in love with the state. We ended up staying a month on Cape Code alone. Falmouth is arguably our favorite city so far.</li>\n<li>NH - We were pleasantly surprised with <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/new-hampshire/\">New Hampshire</a> and can't wait to go back. The state was beautiful and the people were very friendly. We may do a summer sometime in the ME-NH-VT area.</li>\n<li>CA - <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/california/\">California</a> was by far my favorite state. I'd move there if Cathy would join me. We particularly loved the Sequoia and Giant Redwood trees and national parks. We fell in love with northern CA and the central coast (San Luis Obispo / Monterey). However, Cathy is <strong>definitely not a fan</strong> of San Francisco.</li>\n<li>OR - <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/oregon/\">Oregon</a> was a beautiful state and we loved the coast. It was a little cool and windy for us but we had a great time. I loved the atmosphere in Portland and the beer culture. We were there for an entire week and the weather was beautiful! Highly unusual, we hear.</li>\n<li>AK - <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/alaska/\">Alaska</a> is ... well... Alaska and it's incredible. We are still wrapping up the state and I'm trying to convince Cathy to move here. I even promised her that we could start fostering again!</li>\n<li>VA - <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2014/07/16/colonial-williamsburg-rollercoasters/\">Virginia</a> is just a gorgeous state! We have a ton of photos just of the country side. We spent the majority of our time doing historical stuff and would love to go back.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Favorite Cities</strong></p>\n<p>Cathy and I compiled a list our favorite cities and they all coincided with great weather in that area. It may not be fair but the weather at the time of our visit impacts our feelings for the area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2014/06/24/charleston-sc/\">Charleston, SC</a> - Great food, history galore and just a beautiful city. I could eat chicken and waffles every day.</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/01/23/crockpot-turkey-in-the-big-easy/\">New Orleans</a> - We stayed in a crappy RV park just outside of town but everyone had an absolute blast. The girls loved beignets and are asking to go back.</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2014/08/13/we-love-the-big-apple/\">NYC</a> - Everyone had fun in the Big Apple however I think Kira and I are more fond of the city. She and I have talked about moving there someday. Cathy says she'll miss me.</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/03/22/ft-worth-tx/\">Ft Worth, TX</a> - We stayed downtown in the historic rodeo district and did all sorts of cowboy-things. We had a number of friends and family drop in so it was super fun!</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/02/09/san-antonio-tx/\">San Antonio, TX</a> - Cathy has always told me how awesome San Antonio is and she was absolutely correct. We spent almost the entire stay down at the Riverwalk. I could live in San Antonio!</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/05/15/san-luis-obispo-ca/\">San Louis Obispo, CA</a> - The central coast of CA is one of my favorite spots. Nestled between the ocean and the mountains, it doesn't get much better!</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2014/10/05/cape-code-it-was-the-best-of-times-it-was-the-worst-of-times/\">Falmouth, MA</a> - We stayed in Falmouth twice cause it was so awesome! There's a reason why the Cape is so popular.</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2014/07/10/washington-dc-is-totes-awesome/\">Washington, DC</a> - One word: history. Two words: super awesome.</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/04/27/sedona-az/\">Sedona, AZ</a> - Cathy loved Sedona so much that we ended up buying a timeshare there. We'll be back next summer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2014/11/07/holy-crap-maine-is-awesome/\">Bar Harbor, ME</a> - Definitely a future summer spot. Plus, they have a restaurant called &quot;Mainely Meats&quot; that the girls want to eat at again.</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/06/01/juneau-ak/\">Juneau, AK</a> - The weather was perfect in Juneau and we did a ton of great things. One of our favorite stops.</li>\n<li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2015/05/29/portland-or/\">Portland, OR</a> - I could easily live in Portland. It's a weird city with a great beer and tech culture. Like a smaller San Francisco but with the same percentage of homeless.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We polled the girls and these are their favorite cities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lexi - Niagara Falls, Plymouth, NYC &amp; Boston</li>\n<li>Kira - NYC, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Graceland &amp; Niagara Falls</li>\n<li>Hali - Falmouth, Niagara Falls, Las Vegas, San Antonio, Boston (we went to a Red Sox game) &amp; Kenai, AK</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Least Favorite States</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>NJ - I think the jokes about NJ are accurate. Not a fan at all of the state.</li>\n<li>TX - We had good times in San Antonio and Ft. Worth but the rest of the state was disappointing and exhausting to drive .</li>\n<li>VT - It really isn't fair to put Vermont on this list as we were only in the state for one day and it rained the entire time. Perhaps when we head back to Maine sometime we'll give it another shot. Stay classy Vermont!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Least Favorite Cities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Austin - Everyone talks about how awesome Austin is but I thought it was a dump with terrible traffic; worse than LA. I guess if you are single this would be a great place to hang out. Not family friendly.</li>\n<li>San Francisco - I'm a big fan of SF but Cathy has never liked it. She's hated the weather and traffic since the first time she visited. She begrudgingly tolerates it.</li>\n<li>Roswell - I was expecting an awesome &quot;alien adventure&quot; in Roswell but it was far from that. A boring, depressing little town.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Random Observations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>People are super nice all around the country especially in Arkansas.</li>\n<li>We found great sushi in Louisiana.</li>\n<li>Delaware consists mainly of corn fields. Everywhere. Very rural and boring.</li>\n<li>Rhode Island is a beautiful little state. We really liked Providence.</li>\n<li>I did not dislike Los Angeles as much as I anticipated.</li>\n<li>Yosemite National Park was too crowded for us... but fantastic.</li>\n<li>They build crazy awesome playgrounds in Alaska.</li>\n<li>Don't always trust the GPS.</li>\n<li>We could get super fat living in Charleston, SC.</li>\n<li>95% of RV parks are right next to railroad tracks (not a real statistical fact).</li>\n<li>Picnics are awesome in the Giant Redwood forest.</li>\n<li>Sasquatch are hard to find.</li>\n<li>Flip phones still reign supreme in Alaska.</li>\n<li>The Canadian portion of the Alaskan Highway is just as bad as they say it is.</li>\n<li>With my beard I'm easily mistaken as an Alaskan. Honestly.</li>\n<li>I'll be an awesome long haul truck driver if this software thing doesn't work out for me.</li>\n</ul>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"81","plaintext":"Today we are in Kenai, AK celebrating our one year anniversary on this crazy\ntrip across America.

We spent\n   almost the entire stay down at the Riverwalk. I could live in San Antonio!\n * San Louis Obispo, CA [__GHOST_URL__/2015/05/15/san-luis-obispo-ca/] - The\n   central coast of CA is one of my favorite spots. Nestled between the ocean\n   and the mountains, it doesn't get much better!\n * Falmouth, MA\n   [__GHOST_URL__/2014/10/05/cape-code-it-was-the-best-of-times-it-was-the-worst-of-times/] \n   - We stayed in Falmouth twice cause it was so awesome! There's a reason why\n   the Cape is so popular.\n * Washington, DC [__GHOST_URL__/2014/07/10/washington-dc-is-totes-awesome/] -\n   One word: history. Two words: super awesome.\n * Sedona, AZ [__GHOST_URL__/2015/04/27/sedona-az/] - Cathy loved Sedona so much\n   that we ended up buying a timeshare there. We'll be back next summer.\n * Bar Harbor, ME [__GHOST_URL__/2014/11/07/holy-crap-maine-is-awesome/] -\n   Definitely a future summer spot. Plus, they have a restaurant called \"Mainely\n   Meats\" that the girls want to eat at again.\n * Juneau, AK [__GHOST_URL__/2015/06/01/juneau-ak/] - The weather was perfect in\n   Juneau and we did a ton of great things. One of our favorite stops.\n * Portland, OR [__GHOST_URL__/2015/05/29/portland-or/] - I could easily live in\n   Portland. It's a weird city with a great beer and tech culture. Like a\n   smaller San Francisco but with the same percentage of homeless.\n\nWe polled the girls and these are their favorite cities:\n\n * Lexi - Niagara Falls, Plymouth, NYC & Boston\n * Kira - NYC, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Graceland & Niagara Falls\n * Hali - Falmouth, Niagara Falls, Las Vegas, San Antonio, Boston (we went to a\n   Red Sox game) & Kenai, AK\n\nLeast Favorite States\n\n * NJ - I think the jokes about NJ are accurate. Not a fan at all of the state.\n * TX - We had good times in San Antonio and Ft. Worth but the rest of the state\n   was disappointing and exhausting to drive .\n * VT - It really isn't fair to put Vermont on this list as we were only in the\n   state for one day and it rained the entire time. Perhaps when we head back to\n   Maine sometime we'll give it another shot. Stay classy Vermont!\n\nLeast Favorite Cities\n\n * Austin - Everyone talks about how awesome Austin is but I thought it was a\n   dump with terrible traffic; worse than LA. I guess if you are single this\n   would be a great place to hang out. Not family friendly.\n * San Francisco - I'm a big fan of SF but Cathy has never liked it. She's hated\n   the weather and traffic since the first time she visited. She begrudgingly\n   tolerates it.\n * Roswell - I was expecting an awesome \"alien adventure\" in Roswell but it was\n   far from that. A boring, depressing little town.\n\nRandom Observations\n\n * People are super nice all around the country especially in Arkansas.\n * We found great sushi in Louisiana.\n * Delaware consists mainly of corn fields. Everywhere. Very rural and boring.\n * Rhode Island is a beautiful little state. We really liked Providence.\n * I did not dislike Los Angeles as much as I anticipated.\n * Yosemite National Park was too crowded for us... but fantastic.\n * They build crazy awesome playgrounds in Alaska.\n * Don't always trust the GPS.\n * We could get super fat living in Charleston, SC.\n * 95% of RV parks are right next to railroad tracks (not a real statistical\n   fact).\n * Picnics are awesome in the Giant Redwood forest.\n * Sasquatch are hard to find.\n * Flip phones still reign supreme in Alaska.\n * The Canadian portion of the Alaskan Highway is just as bad as they say it is.\n * With my beard I'm easily mistaken as an Alaskan. Honestly.\n * I'll be an awesome long haul truck driver if this software thing doesn't work\n   out for me.","feature_image":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5604/18857812802_ec191be532_c.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-06-17T02:06:05.000Z","updated_at":"2015-06-17T15:12:28.000Z","published_at":"2015-06-17T15:12:28.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f36","uuid":"95bec574-5391-4d27-b392-9571f10a59bc","title":"Loving Alaska's Kenai Peninsula","slug":"kenai-ak","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Loving Alaska's Kenai Peninsula\\n\\n[flickr]\\n\\nDates: June 7th - June 16th  \\nRV Park: [Diamond M Ranch Resort](http://www.diamondmranchresort.com), Kenai, AK\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Loving Alaska's Kenai Peninsula</p>\n<p>[flickr]</p>\n<p>Dates: June 7th - June 16th<br>\nRV Park: <a href=\"http://www.diamondmranchresort.com\">Diamond M Ranch Resort</a>, Kenai, AK</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"82","plaintext":"Loving Alaska's Kenai Peninsula\n\n[flickr]\n\nDates: June 7th - June 16th\nRV Park: Diamond M Ranch Resort [http://www.diamondmranchresort.com], Kenai, AK","feature_image":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/307/18579284081_fdaeca01e9_c.jpg","featured":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-07-19T15:18:08.000Z","updated_at":"2015-07-19T15:19:36.000Z","published_at":"2015-07-19T15:18:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5b598ef74455a90018928f37","uuid":"70fac11a-baf2-4f27-8fbb-130493e62edb","title":"You've been upgraded to the latest version of Ghost","slug":"ghost-0-7","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"You've just upgraded to the latest version of Ghost and we've made a few changes that you should probably know about!\\n\\n## Woah, why does everything look different?\\n\\nAfter two years and hundreds of thousands of users, we learned a great deal about what was (and wasn't) working in the old Ghost admin user interface.

You can insert a card either by\nclicking on the + button on a new line, or typing / on a new line to search for\na particular card. \n\nHere's one now:\n\n> Fun announcement coming this afternoon 🙈 what could it be?\n\n— Ghost (@TryGhost) August 4, 2016\n[https://twitter.com/TryGhost/status/761119175192420352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nCards are rich objects which contain content which is more than just text. To\nstart with there are cards for things like images, markdown, html and embeds —\nbut over time we'll introduce more cards and integrations, as well as allowing\nyou to create your own!\n\nSome examples of possible future cards\n * A chart card to display dynamic data visualisations\n * A recipe card to show a pre-formatted list of ingredients and instructions\n * A Mailchimp card to capture new subscribers with a web form\n * A recommended reading card to display a dynamic suggested story based on the\n   current user's reading history\n\nFor now, though, we're just getting started with the basics.\n\nNew ways to work with images\nPerhaps the most notable change to how you're used to interacting with Ghost is\nin the images. In Koenig, they're both more powerful and easier to work with in\nthe editor itself - and in the theme, they're output slightly differently with\ndifferent size options.\n\nFor instance, here's your plain ol' regular image:\n\nA regular size imageBut perhaps you've got a striking panorama that you really\nwant to stand out as your readers scroll down the page. In that case, you could\nuse the new full-bleed image size which stretches right out to the edges of the\nscreen:\n\nIt's wideOr maybe you're looking for something in between, which will give you\njust a little more size to break up the vertical rhythm of the post without\ndominating the entire screen. If that's the case, you might like the breakout\nsize:\n\nIt's wider, but not widestEach of these sizes can be selected from within the\neditor, and each will output a number of HTML classes for the theme to do\nstyling with. \n\nChances are your theme will need a few small updates to take advantage of the\nnew editor functionality. Some people might also find they need to tweak their\ntheme layout, as the editor canvas previously output a wrapper div around its\ncontent – but no longer does. If you rely on that div for styling, you can\nalways add it back again in your theme.\n\nOh, we have some nice new image captions, too :)\n\nWhat else?\nWell, you can still write Markdown, as mentioned. In fact you'll find the entire\nprevious Ghost editor inside this editor. If you want to use it then just go\nahead and add a Markdown card and start writing like nothing changed at all:\n\nMarkdown content works just the way it always did, simply and beautifully.\n\nof course you can embed code blocks\n\n.new-editor {\n\tdisplay: bock;\n}\n\nor embed things from external services like YouTube...\n\nand yeah you can do full HTML if you need to, as well!\n\nhello worldSo everything works, hopefully, just about how you would expect. It's\nlike the old editor, but faster, cleaner, prettier, and a whole lot more\npowerful.\n\nWhat do I do with this information?\nPreview this post on your site to see if it causes any issues with your theme.\nClick on the settings cog in the top right 👉🏼 corner of the editor, then click\non 'Preview' next to the 'Post URL' input.\n\nIf everything looks good to you then there's nothing you need to do, you're all\nset! If you spot any issues with your design, or there are some funky display\nissues, then you might need to make some updates to your theme based on the new\neditor classes being output.\n\nHead over to the Ghost 2.0 Theme Compatibility\n[https://forum.ghost.org/t/ghost-2-0-theme-compatibility-help-support/2103] \nforum topic to discuss any changes and get help if needed.\n\nThat's it!\n\nWe're looking forward to sharing more about the new editor
